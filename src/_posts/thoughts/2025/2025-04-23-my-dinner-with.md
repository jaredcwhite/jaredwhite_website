You know those sorts of conversations you have with old friends when you get together after a long absence and you just talk and talk and talk for hours upon hours about a great many things both lofty and lowly and everything in between?

**I'm grateful to have had several of those conversations over the past few days.** And it's given me much food for thought. Good friends help stimulate your imagination in ways you didn't anticipate, or perhaps reinforce vague ideas you were wary of ruminating on too much in a vacuum. And perhaps most of all, they help you feel less alone in this world.

**Value such relationships.** They are all too rare, too fleeting.
