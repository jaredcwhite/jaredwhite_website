I'm in the midst of #writing my first travelogue installment to publish here on the blog since I embarked on the #NomadLifestyle, and I'm quickly realizing I don't really have any template, any "grid" to follow. I'm generally so used to consuming (and [occasionally making!](/browse/videos)) **travel vlogs**, and let's face it, video is a very good medium to show off travel & adventure.

Yet there's a longstanding tradition of people spending time on the road and then writing about it. Unfortunately I can't say I am sophisticated enough to have read much of it.

I suppose I could search the web for what other people have written, and copy that. However I worry that in doing so, I'll end up simply trying to sound like those other people. I'm very protective of _my own voice_ in this matter. **There's a reason I haven't been filming any travel vlogs in this season.** I did think about it a lot. In the end, I decided it would diminish my experienceâ€”and add a great deal of stress to the situationâ€”if I were swallowed up in the need to focus on _how to film_ my travelsâ€¦and how people would receive it.

I have no interest in becoming "a professional YouTuber"â€”and in fact **I have a bit of a critique lurking in my brain somewhere** with regard to the class dynamics between attractive Millennials showing off a glamorous world-traveling lifestyle vs. the very real fact that sometimes you're sharing space in a parking lot or a public restroom with people who are very much down on their luck and by no means feeling glam.

Hence my travelogue will be frank, honest, raw, and hopefully enjoyable for the most part. **I make no guarantees.** This isn't a performance for me, nor is it a career. This is my actual life I'm living. You'll get a taste of the bad and the good alike. Make of it what you will! ðŸ˜…
