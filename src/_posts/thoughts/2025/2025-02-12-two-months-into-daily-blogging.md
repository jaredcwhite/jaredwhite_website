title: Two Months into Daily Blogging and I Hate It

**PSYCH!** ðŸ˜œ

[I announced back on December 7](/20241207/daily-blogging-in-2025) I'd be daily blogging throughout 2025, and then [on January 4](/20250104/first-four-weeks-of-daily-blogging) I offered an initial assessment as to how things were going (as I'd actually started right then and there in December as a trial balloon).

Here's what I think now, two months in:

**I love it! But I wish I'd given myself a "get out of blogging free" card I could use once, perhaps twice a month.**

<u style="text-decoration: wavy underline; color: var(--strong-color)">The Good</u>: the imperative that _I simply must do it_ every day solves a ton of scheduling headaches. No need to keep track of when I last posted or when I should post next if it's every day like clockwork! And the drive to have to do this frequently means I've covered a much wider range of topics than I might have otherwise.

<u style="text-decoration: wavy underline; color: var(--strong-color)">The Bad</u>: like I said, I do wish I'd given myself the occasional "out". Every now and then, when I am ill or extremely tired or life just gets in the way, I'd love to be able to say "oh well, better luck next time" instead of having to half-ass cobble something together at the last minute (and I mean _literally like 11:59 at night_ on an occasion or two!).

I think, when this challenge is over, I'll come up with a system along those lines. Yet the core habits I'm forming now â€” #writing on a daily basis come hell or high water â€” will serve me well long into the future.

While I work during the day as a web programmer, I consider myself first and foremost a **web publisher**. This is my calling in life, even if it's not my principal vocation, and it feels ever more true as time passes. Some day, my career as a programmer may draw to a close. But writing? **I'll keep doing that until such day the breath leaves my body.**
