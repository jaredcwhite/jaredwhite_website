Welp, the day has finally arrived. Bluesky is being invaded by fascist dickwads, as none other than **JD Vance** is now posting on the service…bringing a bunch of his imbecilic sycophants screaming at the "libtards" with him. And _of course_ he's spewing absolute gutter trash; offensive anti-trans talking points which are also anti-science.

Which of course leaves me wondering: **Why the fuck am I using this service??**

_I have never liked Bluesky._ Never. I think "ATProto" is basically a scam. It's not a true decentralized open standard social networking protocol. It's a cover story for a corporate entity which exists presumably to make money (and can't even manage that at present), and it's a massive distraction from the _real_ decentralized open standard open web social network—which of course is the #Fediverse running on ActivityPub.

But sure, I have been using Bluesky *purely as a consumer* for a while now because, hey, **I already kicked Threads to the curb** and "had" to go somewhere for certain news sources—mainly U.S. #politics, some general tech, and micromobility/urbanism. I don't really post on Bluesky at all. I occasionally reply with a comment. That's it.

Now I'm questioning even that base level of engagement. I can "subscribe" to a few accounts via RSS, and honestly, I think that may be enough for me.
