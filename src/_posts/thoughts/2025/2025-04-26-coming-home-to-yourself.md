Look at me.

You made this decision long ago.

The Empire cannot win.

You'll never feel right unless you're doing what you can to stop them.

Incredible, incredible stuff.

[As I wrote back in March](/links/20250303/putting-the-wars-in-star-wars), I consider _Star Wars: Andor_ to be one of the best #scifi #tvshows of all time. Three episodes into the second season, and that continues to be the case. The above speech right at the start of S2E1 by Cassian Andor himself is sheer brilliance. **I take these words to heart in my own time.**
