title: Losing the Fun of Being a Newbie (and Trying to Get it Back)

There's a certain something to the work you do as a "newbie". Yes it's raw, rough around the edges, lacking polish and finesse. But it has something else too. A certain _joie de vivre_, a bit of swagger, an amusing sense of misplaced confidence in itself.

Later work, more mature work, more refined work may be "better" in a number of waysâ€¦but it can also feel studious. Stuffy. Safe. Lacking that potent energy which can be found in #creativity unfettered by the baggage of lengthy experience.

Perhaps the great artists manage to find the right balance. They constantly challenge themselves to put on a beginner's mind once again; to forget how to be great and to embrace "poverty". **After all, so much of the great art is born of constraint.** Little use in being able to do it all when sometimes doing very little is all you need.
