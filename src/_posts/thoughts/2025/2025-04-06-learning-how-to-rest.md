What happens when you feel like you have jet lag but it's #NomadLifestyle car lag? ðŸ¥´

I really struggled this weekend with feeling like I'm well-rested. I've come to discover there's a lot of "dead space" in your life when you're housed. Like, you can just sit in a chair or lie down on your bed and "veg". When you're car camping and traveling all over the damn place, there's not a lot of "veg" time unless you intentionally remember to do that. Even _just chilling out_ in some grand location with a breathtaking vista can feel a bit like work, because **your brain is so active**. It's simply too much stimulation.

[I posted on Mastodon yesterday](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite/114288417606103434) about how I'd promised myself I'd take it easy, then somehow roped myself into this huge hike that went sideways. ðŸ˜¬ Today, I was so-o-o wiped out. **I felt like a zombie all morning.** Plus I had a ton of digital paperwork I needed to catch up on, which isn't fun under the best of circumstances.

But I really forced myself to take a slower pace, to make time where I'm sort of just not doing anything. For example, instead of parking somewhere new and then _immediately_ getting out of the car to go do the thing I intended to do, I sat and _did nothing_ for a little while. Watched some people walk by. Observed rain drops on my windshield. Listened to a podcast that I was only half-engaged with.

**That felt really nice.** And even though I'm posting this in the evening, I have more energy than I did this morning. Perhaps I'll get the hang of this yet. Yay! ðŸ˜Œ

P.S. I'm hoping to post a bit of a travelogue (travelblog?) with pictures soon. Just need to process more photos and set aside time for the writeup. Fingers crossed! ðŸ¤ž
