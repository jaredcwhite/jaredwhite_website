Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, has some _very_ interesting things to say!

To whit, this CNN article [Today’s CEOs are the last to manage all-human workforces, says Marc Benioff](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/23/business/davos-marc-benioff-salesforce-ai-prediction-intl/index.html):

> “From this point forward… we will be managing not only human workers but also digital workers,” he said on a panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland…Benioff also said Thursday that AI and humans can work together “to create a higher level of success.”

Wow, that all sounds very bold and future-y! And then there's this:

> The rise of #generativeAI "agents," which Benioff described Wednesday as "digital labor," is among the next wave of advancements for the tech. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/22/salesforce-chief-ai-agents-davos))

Digital labor—amazing! I guess that's like human labor, only digital!

Speaking of Axios, they have some fantastic news for us all:

> Architects of the leading generative AI models are abuzz that a top company, possibly OpenAI, in coming weeks will announce a next-level breakthrough that unleashes Ph.D.-level super-agents to do complex human tasks. ([source](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/19/ai-superagent-openai-meta))

Wow! We're not just getting AI agents this year, we're getting AI **super-agents**! _With Ph.D.s!_

Now I just have a few simple questions for you, Mr. Marc Benioff CEO sir. This won't take long. Thank you for your valuable time!

1. Will your digital workers sit down with their managers periodically for performance reviews?
2. What kind of severance packages will you offer digital workers who are terminated?
3. Which currency will you be using to pay your digital workers? The US Dollar? Or crypto?
4. Will the amount of PTO granted to digital workers be the same as human workers?
5. What is your stance on organized digital labor? Do you support the rights of digital workers to unionize?
6. Let's say one of your digital workers and one of your human workers become romantically involved. What is your office policy on human-AI relationships?
7. Do you intend to offer digital workers a stipend for career development? Or perhaps fitness? (I'm assuming digital workers, having no bodies to speak of, would go to virtual gyms where they can exercise their human-impersonation skills.)
8. Which websites will you use to advertise job openings for digital workers? My understanding is that current job boards assume all the applicants are human. Seems like an area ripe for disruption!
9. What new training will you provide your HR departments so they can handle complaints of sexual harassment of digital workers by human workers?
10. How soon will a digital executive be hired as CEO of Salesforce?

What's that? The mic's not working? You're being called away on urgent business? **Oh dear, I was really looking forward to your answers!**
