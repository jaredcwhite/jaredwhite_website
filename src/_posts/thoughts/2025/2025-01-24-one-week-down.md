The world-weariness I feel after only a hundred (and change) hours living under a Trump presidency is hard to put into words.

I knew it would be **bad**, but I don't think I was prepared for the _rawness_ of the feelings that I feel. I know a great many of my fedi-friends feel exactly the same way.

I wish I could be #writing about uplifting things, filled with joy and optimism. I really do. I realize I keep saying this for some reason, but I _naturally_ am a very "glass half-full" sort of person. I am not typically a grump, but I can come across that way on social media because I post so often on the absolutely batshit crazy stuff I see happening. Like [Jewel performing at (checks notes) a Trump Inauguration Day ball "honoring" RFK Jr.](https://deadline.com/2025/01/jewel-apologizes-performing-inauguration-donald-trump-health-secretary-rfk-jr-1236267222/) and then (kinda sorta) apologizing for it afterwards all while completely centering herself and her feelings which [seems to be going around a lot these days](https://social.lol/@adam/113884279391661561).

I literally cannot watch her weird, weird IG video without my eyes rolling way, way back into the back of my head. A certain word comes to mind: it starts with a "c" and ends with "ollaborator". ðŸ™„

I'll repeat what I've been saying regarding a wide variety of recent scenarios: **what bothers me more** than the outright American Nazis and fascists themselves are the **mealy-mouthed, cowardly** people who either find ways to defend them or find ways to defend other people who don't seem to be bothered by associating with them.

Remember that "c" word I mentioned above?

I don't blame MAGA for being MAGA, in a sense. They are bold and forthcoming with their hate and stupidity. You know where you stand with them. What I _absolutely cannot abide_ are the moderates & "progressives" who think the things we should really be focusing on right now are tone-policing, bridge-building, and letting bygones be bygones if someone issues an _oopsie poopsie_.

**Fuck that shit.**

I found this informative chart in a [PDF by UK-based LGBT Great](https://www.lgbtgreat.com/sites/default/files/2024-06/Striving%20For%20More%20Authentic%20Allyship%20Guide.pdf) which highlights some concrete differences between _performative allyship_ and _authentic allyship_:

![Examples when celebrating pride month, seeing a colleague making a racist comment, or addressing gender inequality](/20250124/true-allyship.jpg)

One of the themes you may pick up on is the difference between being _reactive_ and being _proactive_. Authentic allyship isn't about reacting to issues after they become apparent, but about taking meaningful steps to avoid issues in the first place. By the time you are being called out and have to address a real problem (by "apologizing"), it's already _way_ past the point when you should have been doing something useful in the first place.

So, at the risk of being accused of being part of a "woke mob" or a "growing legion" or whatever dumb term people want to throw out in bad faith, I am going to continue speaking out about this stuff. And if I screw up too down the road? I'll say "Damn, I'm sorry I fucked up so bad. You are right to call me out on this. I'm listening, and perhaps one day I might earn back your trust." _That's it. That's the toot._
