I will _never forgive_ the tech industry for what it has done to the world I was brought up into as a technologist.

**I was literally raised by a programmer.** My dad was a Unix guy long before I ever knew what Unix is. No joke, I'd heard of **SGML** before I'd heard of **HTML**. To this day I don't consider myself much of a Vim whiz, but the reason I even know how to use it is because I first cut my teeth on Vi. I supposed if my dad had been into Emacs, I would have learned that instead!

I had already been a computer user—and budding programmer myself—for literally a decade before I even encountered the #OpenWeb on top of this newfangled thing called the Internet. I like to joke I was already using a computer when I was 2 years old. I'm not sure if that's strictly speaking true, but _close enough!_

I say all this because you deserve the preamble to my pricipal statement: as someone in their 40s _who's been a hard-core computer nerd for nearly that long_, I find the end result of the now vast corporations in control of said computer field to be **deplorable**, **ghastly**, **boneheaded**, **ludicrous**, and **fucking absurd**.

I can barely even stomach anything Apple is churning out these days, and they're one of the _least_ disagreeable firms if you can believe it.

This isn't "old man yells at cloud". Because the truth is, there's actually _tons_ of **awesome technology** being worked on and demonstrated every day. And the Web itself is a marvel of engineering, better now than it's ever been and capable of oh so much.

So if there's so much **good tech** available, how come there is so much **bad tech** thrown in our faces at the exact same time? We can all offer some plausible answers to that question, but in the end it doesn't matter much. **This is the world we now live in.** Oodles of good tech, surrounded and nearly infected by a veritable flood of _very bad tech_.

And I nearly can't stand it. ☹️
