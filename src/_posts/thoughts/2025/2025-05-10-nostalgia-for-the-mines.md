title: Nostalgia for the Mines
tags: movies

As a child‚Ä¶well, **I did not yearn for the mines.** üòâ But as a father of kids circa early 2020s, I have many fond memories of playing Minecraft (Java Edition) together as a family for hours upon hours upon hours. I'm also a huge fan of the Minecraft soundtrack by C418‚Äî[Aria Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOIEo_74L-Q) is sheer perfection.

I was hoping to see the new Minecraft Movie with my kids, but they beat me to it with another group of friends/family. So I finally went by myself to see it (don't feel bad for me, I _love_ going to the cinema alone).

**CHICKEN JOCKEY!**

You just knew I had to say it. üòÇ

I don't know what beef some critics had with this movie. Maybe it just doesn't land if you're not a massive Minecraft nerd. I wouldn't say I'm totally a nerd ([my game franchise of choice is Myst](/podcast/117/)), but I have enough experience with it that I had an absolute blast (TNT of course) watching this very weird and goofy take on the game. Everyone seemed to be acting the hell out of themselves and having great fun, and while it's fair to say the film is thin on plot and very intent on a-meme-every-second pacing, I was totally there for it.

Plus who doesn't love a few very comedic moments with Jennifer Coolidge. She is every bit as delightfully wacky as you might expect!

Am I excited for the inevitable sequel, given the fact they've raked in an eye-watering amount of dough from this one? _[Heh!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPnZLTZRYw)_

‚≠êÔ∏è **4.5 out of 5 stars.**
