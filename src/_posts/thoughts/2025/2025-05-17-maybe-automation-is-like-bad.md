title: Maybe Automation is, Like, Uh, Yâ€™know, Actually Kinda Bad

**Stop me if you've heard this one:**

"Gee, we have all sorts of automation when it comes to manufacturing goods, and sometimes that's put people out of work and stuff. Oh well! The Industrial Age has been great for humanity. So what's wrong with automating intellectual work sometimes? The Age of AI will also be great for humanity!"

The foolish person would concede the first point, while continuing to engage on the question of intellectual automation.

I think it will benefit us to apply some wisdom here and question the initial premise. Because, y'know, maybeâ€”**just maybe!**â€”the automated manufacturing of physical goods is **also bad.**

_Shock!_ _Gasp!_ _Horror!_ ðŸ˜±

Look, I won't pretend to argue we shouldn't have _any_ factories and machinery. I can't even imagine a modern world without industry. There certainly wouldn't be the Internet, computers, etc., so it's rather pointless to debate that, right?

And yet, I think we _should_ have a debate on just how much "junk" gets manufactured, sold, and then discardedâ€”ending up in ever-expanding landfills. The amount of literal trash modern society generates is unfathomable. The deleterious effects on the environment are truly alarming. The poor quality of life of many factory workers across the globe is appalling. The loss of skill, the death of craftsmanship, the fact that so many people's homes and places of work are filled with crappy mass-produced items of little meaningful artistic merit instead of handmade objects by creative individualsâ€”**these are real issues of grave concern.**

I think it's shameful that a glib response to the rise of "intellectual automation" (assuming #generativeAI is even truly capable of that nowâ€¦itself a highly contested point!) touting the perceived success of industrial automation is just taken as a given. Is it really the _totally coolest thing ever_ that you can buy a mass produced scarf for cheap (maybe not so cheap nowâ€¦thanks Trump tariffs! ðŸ˜‚) at Walmart rather than purchase a one-of-a-kind shawl by a local craftsperson which undoubtedly costs more?

**On a related noteâ€¦**

Are you aware of the huge uprising against automobiles taking over city streets in the early 1900s? Are you aware of the massive campaigns by auto makers to sway public opinion? Did you know they *literally invented* the term "jaywalking" to make the perfectly reasonable goal of, er, walking across a street [perceived as foolish? Even illegal?](https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history)

Did you know that when someone accuses you of being a "luddite" for avoiding some newfangled technology, they are (likely unwittingly) referring to a movement in England which smashed looms in protest against horrible factory conditions and whose leaders were subsequently executed for their "crimes"?

The Industrial Revolution was a "success"â€¦because the protesters were shot. _That's not even an exaggeration!_

As I [keep saying until I'm blue in the face](https://theinternet.review/2025/05/13/you-do-not-get-to-die-on-the-vibe-coding-hill-simon/), we *desperately* need a reset when it comes to the AI conversation because if something doesn't change fast, **we will end up making many of the same mistakes society made in the last round of automation reshaping civilization.** And I am unconvinced we've even made it out of _that_ hype cycle with our moral fiber intact.
