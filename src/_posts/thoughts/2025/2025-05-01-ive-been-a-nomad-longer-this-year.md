While we're on the subject of major milestones ([I recently celebrated having daily-blogged one third of 2025 thus far](/20250430/one-third-daily-blogging-completed)), it only just occurred to me that I have been living the #NomadLifestyle for longer than living in a house this year. ðŸ¤¯

Since I moved out at the end of February, and that's an extra-short month, January + February comes out to less than than March + April. **Boom!**

If you had told me at any point last year that by mid-spring this year I would have been traveling full-time for longer than I lived in a house, I would have looked at you like you were smokin' somethin'. But "misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows" and it tookâ€”well, it took the descent of America into a fascist dictatorship and the moral implosion of Big Tech and the aftermath of personal/family battles to get me to realize **life on the road** is actually the least risky maneuver if I wanted to maintain a modicum of sanity in this upside-down world. ðŸ˜‚
