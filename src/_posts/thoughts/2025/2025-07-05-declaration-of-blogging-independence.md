title: I Declare Independenceâ€¦From My Blog! ðŸ˜œ
tags: writing
---

I suppose it's fitting that the first day since last year (in early December!) I truly skipped a day in my daily-blogging challenge is July 4th, also known here in the U.S. as Independence Day. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸŽ†

**I hereby declare my independence from #writing every day!** ðŸ˜†

OK, this wasn't entirely an accident. I [recently talked about](/20250623/blogging-every-day-oh-dear) how much I'd been enjoying this challenge over all yet I wish I'd given myself an "out" from having to do it without fail, without any breaks, _every single day_.

After never breaking my daily blogging streak for over six months (!!), the time has come to make those tweaks! So I've given myself **a maximum of four skip days a month**. That means I _could_ essentially take a day off each week, or I could save my skips and cluster them together. At any rate, I'm no longer worried about breaking my streak, because that's built into the framework.

To be clear though, **I'm definitely NOT giving up daily blogging!** As I keep saying, it's been absolutely incredible for me and has reshaped my relationship with writing this year. I no longer consider it merely a hobby. [Twelve years ago I mused on the thought](/articles/i-am-a-writer) that "at some point I will officially make the transition from amateur writer to professional."

That's [exactly what I'm doing](https://buttondown.com/theinternet) at this point in time. And not just a professional writerâ€”[a professional podcaster](https://vibecoded.transistor.fm) as well. So yeah, it's no longer an option for me to flake out and not "do the stuff" for long periods of time. I've "gone pro" as it were, and I increasingly see that taking up a meaningful portion of my overall efforts as a creator.
