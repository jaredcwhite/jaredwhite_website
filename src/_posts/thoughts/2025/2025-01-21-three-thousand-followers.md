**We did it, #Fediverse!**

![Data fist pump YES](/20250121/fist-pump-data.gif){: style="width: 475px"}

I know I don't look it (😉), but I've been publishing on the #OpenWeb for oh so long now (how many decades has it been again?!), and never in that time have I reached a stat like this. Not on any past platform, not even on Twitter in the good (_sorta bad though lol_) ol' days.

**Mastodon, I thank you from the bottom of my heart!** 🙏

3,000 followers of [@jaredwhite@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite) is a number that may not mean much to some because they have a much higher number, but I'm here to say **I don't at all take any of it for granted**. I also realize these are "vanity metrics" and to be evaluated with a huge grain of salt (I suspect the number of actual humans seeing any of my toots is but a fraction of that). And I also also realize that some of you may have recently left commercial social media behind with large follower counts, and it's _hard_ to start over from scratch here on the indie social web.

**I see you.** 💛

And I'm here to support your efforts to regroup and rebuild away from the hellscapes of corporate silos. I am as dedicated as I've ever been to growing (yes, _growing!_) the Fediverse, and every single example of my own success which I can point to in promoting\* Mastodon et al.…well it's simply divine.

**Here's to the next big milestone: 5,000!** 😎

\* In case you're wondering, I most definitely promote Mastodon to people IRL! You put me in a room with anyone even remotely talking about digital marketing, content creation, or online community, and I loudly & proudly extoll the virtues of the burgeoning social web! 😊
