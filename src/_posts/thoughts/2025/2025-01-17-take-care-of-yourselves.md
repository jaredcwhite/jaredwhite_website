This is for my fellow Yanks out there: **Take care of yourselves and your loved ones this weekend.**

I just want you to know I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with all of the people out there who have even more reason to be afraid come January 20th than I do (being a white man). I know how hard this must be for you, because there are people I love very close to me who—if you pay attention to the rhetoric—are living with MAGA targets on their backs. It's shameful. It's appalling. It's #politics with very few guardrails left.

And yet…**we will get through this**. We must. I keep telling that to myself every day. _We have to keep going_. Because the alternative is…unimaginable.

So I wish you all good wishes, and know that **you are not alone**. Millions upon millions of your fellow Americans **are just as appalled** as you are, and this ain't over. MAGA can believe they "won" all they want, but the war for the soul of this nation continues, and we live to fight another day. **Resist!** ✊
