I've always been a wanderer. I don't like "planning" trips. Never have. I've almost never "gone on vacation" in the typical sense of the term. I don't book a week at some theme park in Orlando and get flights a year in advance. In fact, any sort of big trip that's several months out I find almost unbearably stressful leading up to it. I'd rather not have _anything_ several months out. ðŸ˜…

I'm more of a **"let's see what's around that next bend"** kind of guy. Most places I've ever stayed at I've booked a day in advance, if that. I don't care much about seasons. I've gone to a lot of places in the winter that are mainly busy in the summer, and I've gone to places which are busy in the winter, in the summer.

I like going on roads I've never been on. **Don't care much where they lead.**

"Paradise" to me isn't sipping cocktails by a pool at a tropical resort. Listen, I've done that already. It's cool, sure. But I'm just as happyâ€”**perhaps even more so**â€”trudging through a dirt path in the middle of the woods in the middle of nowhere.

I guess that's why the #NomadLifestyle works so well for me. For the most part, it's *never* about the destination, and it's *always* about the journey.

_Taking things just one day at a time. That's the way I like it._
