I've decided as soon as the first Public Beta of iOS 26 is released, I will be installing it on my #iPhonePro.

I've been running the Developer Betas on my iPad Pro since right after WWDC, and despite all the usual visual glitchiness and springboard crashes you get with early betas, it's been absolutely worth it. **iPadOS feels like a productivity workhorse** in a way it never has before‚Äîespecially when plugged into an external monitor‚Äîand I've _really_ been enjoying Liquid Glass. ü§© iOS 17 on my iPhone feels positively lifeless and dull in comparison.

I haven't yet decided when I'll be installing macOS Tahoe on my Mac mini. The truth of the matter is, I don't use that computer much anymore now that I've been experimenting with the "iPad Desktop" lifestyle. _Shocking, I know!_

(Plus the main thing I still absolutely need that Mac for is my music production workflow in Logic Pro, and I don't want to mess that up with a beta OS!)

This is all quite the exciting vibe shift since last year when I _refused_ to install any of the OS upgrades that cycle. I will coast into Q3 2025 having never used any system software #Apple released last year. **What a weird time that was‚Ä¶sure glad to be out of those doldrums!** üëè
