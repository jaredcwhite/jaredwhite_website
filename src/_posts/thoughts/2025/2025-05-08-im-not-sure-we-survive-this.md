title: I’m Not Sure We Survive This
tags: generativeai openweb

I want to assure you, as I write this I am completely relaxed, having enjoyed an extremely delightful day and currently car camping in a glorious field on a hilltop overlooking a beautiful valley. So I am anything but agitated as I utter these somber words:

**I am no longer certain the #OpenWeb and the digital culture we have created for ourselves will survive for much longer.**

The built environment of the Internet is being systematically destroyed by #GenerativeAI. I consider the deployment of software such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Sora, etc. to be, put simply, the digital equivalent of clear-cutting a forest.

There will be nothing left when they're through with it.

As a side effect of this new world order, I increasingly find it hard to justify to myself spending much time online, beyond mainly following some news sources and creators I care about (via free or paid subscriptions). I go back and read articles I wrote in the past—[The Web is the Opposite of Dead](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/the-web-is-the-opposite-of-dead) for example—which sung the praises of how much of our daily lives are spent online, and **I cringe**.

I now believe the Covid pandemic paved the way for an alarming breakdown in civil society which has been exploited by unbridled Big Tech and radical fascists.

I am haunted by this quote I read today:

> “The right-wing attack on universities and the widespread use of ChatGPT to replace thinking and writing are two sides of the same relentless assault on what the Greeks called paideia: the education and development of citizens as ethical beings engaged in their communities.”  
> –[Spencer Beswick (@spencerbeswick@kolektiva.social)](https://kolektiva.social/@spencerbeswick/114469286889198096)

And as multiple essayists have been pointing out for a while now, Generative AI is the new aesthetics of fascism. I consider these movements joined at the hip. Generative AI is the dark side of capitalism dialed up to 11. It is _outrageously_ extractive—suck all the value out of every creative ecosystem and provide virtually no value in return…all so that a small number of fat cats at the top of the food chain gain all the power and resources of the entire system.

I really am at a lost how we move past this. I still believe the AI bubble will burst spectacularly, but that moment still feels rather far off and my existential fear is that by the time it _finally_ does, **it will have been too late.**

In other words, I don't know if the bubble bursts before or after the Internet has been destroyed.

In the end, we may only have lingering remnants of the Fediverse and the Blogosphere and Wikipedia left, more or less. What else is there to hold the line against the ["gray goo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo)-ification wrought by viral AI?

**Nothing beside remains.**

> I met a traveller from an antique land,  
> Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
> And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
> My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.”  
> –[Percy Bysshe Shelley](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias)
