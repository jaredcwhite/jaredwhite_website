I've been going through my mother's ancient stash of papers I had buried in my closet and, well, I found some pretty interesting reading. 😉

Here's what Deborah had to say about **Baby Jared** (that's me!) on **April 20, 1983** when I was only a few months old:

**“**I am amazed at how much Choo Choo (Jared Christopher) has learned so far and how quickly he has progressed. His grandmother Carlita said: 'Write it all down before you forget.' So I am.

From birth on -  
The first thing I heard, from Bear [this was her nickname for my dad Chris], was 'Deb it's a boy!' I then repeated, over and over: 'I can't believe it! I can't believe it!' But I **did** believe it. I knew he was a boy - my heart's desire.

The nurses were amazed at several things. He craned his neck and held his head up when he was two days old! They were hard pressed to believe it. One nurse, Sheila, fell in love with him. Another nurse told me that Jared was Sheila's favorite baby. Sheila came in one night and said: 'I think he's a genius or something. He's so sensitive and alert - not like the other babies. When they cry he looks all around.' Alertness has been a key word. People consistency mention how alert he is.**”**

Mommy, as I called her, **passed away from cancer** in 2006. Thus I cherish hearing her say these words out loud in my mind as I read them. And of course, I also appreciate being called a genius…
