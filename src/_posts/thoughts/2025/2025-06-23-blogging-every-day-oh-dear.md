title: Iâ€™ve Been Blogging Every Day andâ€¦Oh Dear

I've been #writing and publishing a new blog post here or a few other destinations **every single day** since early December 2024.

_Every single day._

And I'm getting pretty tired of it. ðŸ˜…

Don't get me wrong! **I love blogging**, and I really do enjoy the challenge of daily publishing. I just wish I'd given myself an "out" (I've talked about this before). Like maybe I get up to 4 "skips" per month or something like that. Or I allow myself to take a few days break every quarter.

**I'll definitely be tweaking this schedule** at some point in the near future. I'm just not sure yet if I want to get to the full year for _the ultimate bragging rights_, or if I want to say enough is enough and make the change earlier.

What do you think?
