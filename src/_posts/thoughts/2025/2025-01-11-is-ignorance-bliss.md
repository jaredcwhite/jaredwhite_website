title: Is Ignorance Bliss?

One of the most distressing things I am challenged by as 2025 kicks off is the realization that a significant percentage of people _enjoy_ being deceived and _want_ to keep being deceived.

There's that pivotal moment in _The Matrix_ where Cypher is commenting on the fake nature of his unreality:

> You know, I know this steak doesn’t exist. I know that when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, you know what I realize? **Ignorance is bliss.**

Just as Cypher is yearning to return to eating fake steaks and living a fake lifestyle of fake comfort and adulation, many people seem to yearn for fake news and #generativeAI slop and the ceaseless noise of scorched-earth online #politics. They think nothing of the technologies and platforms actively engaged in **mass deception** as well as industrial-scale theft. Who cares if you have to strip mine the Internet in order to make a "funny" meme featuring fictionalized people concerning an event which likely didn't even happen but whatever because you're owning the libs?

In times past, we would worry about singular governmental officials such Joseph Goebbels becoming a master of propaganda for their cause. Today's problem is massively scaled out in ways Goebbels could only dream of: now _everyone_ can be their own Goebbels. Can someone please tell me what the difference is between an "influencer" holding a smartphone and…a propagandist? **Because I simply can't see the distinction anymore.**

[Mark Zuckerberg has claimed](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24341039/meta-apple-mark-zuckerberg-trash-talks-joe-rogan-interview) "There isn’t a physical world and a digital world anymore. We’re in 2025. It’s one world."

_Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!_

In the film world of _The Matrix_, humans were able to escape the Matrix and experience true reality. We seem not to be afforded that same luxury today, because in this reality, **The Real World and The Matrix are one**.
