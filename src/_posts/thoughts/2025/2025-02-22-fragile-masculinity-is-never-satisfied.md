title: Fragile Masculinity is Never Ever Satisfied
tags: gender

The extreme ends of performative #gender expressions, for both men and women, are truly pits of despair. Because no matter how much of a woman you are as a woman, you can still be "more woman"—and the same is true for men. **You are never man enough.** And so you have to be "more man" and then "more man" yet again. There's no end to this Sisyphean loop.

Alas, performative masculinity—particularly its extreme form of _fragile masculinity_ which inevitably leads to _toxic masculinity_—is quite literally tearing my country 🇺🇸 apart right now and is infecting business, art, technology, politics, and more across the globe.

A couple of links I want to share with you, the second nicely reinforcing the first.

**First:** one of my favorite video essayists, Adam Conover, [produced what I think is one of his best yet titled **Elon and Zuck are INSECURE Men**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol4X6oc-tz8). Adam goes right for it, explaining how so many of the bizarro-world activities we see both Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg engaging in—even down to the over-the-top "bro" dress code—are in essence flagrant attempts to prove how manly they are. Their fragile masculinity has metastasized into toxic masculinity, and due to the fact they also happen to be multibillionaires with obscene control over vast swaths of digital commerce and communication, their personal crisis unfortunately affect us all.

The crazy part about all this, as Adam explains and as my next link will prove, is that **it doesn't work!** Extreme performative masculinity doesn't work. Outside of the "bro bubble" and weird far-right echo chambers, nobody is looking to these dudes and thinking "ayup, that is the kind of man I aspire to be." These people aren't men's men—truly, a man's man doesn't look how they look and act like they act.

**They are fools.**

That's it. That's the toot.

**Second:** [TechCrunch reports on a recent Pew Research Center study](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/mark-zuckerbergs-makeover-didnt-make-people-like-him-study-shows/) which shows that Musk is now viewed unfavorably more than favorably in the U.S.—and Zuck is viewed _even more_ unfavorably, with 67% feeling negatively toward him.

> While Zuck may be playing the part of the cool guy, Americans haven’t been fooled by his gold chains or musical ambitions, it seems.

_Ya think?!_

Look, there's no doubt that the present-day issues of masculine culture and what it means to be a man—especially for young men with uncertain job prospects and challenges organically making friends and or meeting potential love interests—can be complex and nuanced. Adam's video makes that point well. It doesn't do anyone any good to simply shout "MEN SUCK!" and leave it there. There needs to be real and ongoing work done to help men and to counter the toxic narratives which are dominating out there.

At the same time, I also get uncomfortable focusing too much on this topic from a "gendered" perspective. Part of me wants to deconstruct gender performance entirely, [as I said in a previous post:](/20241211/post-toxic-masculinity)

> My wish is we could spend less time talking about “what women should be like” or “what men should be like” and simply talk about “what humans should be like”. And that list really shouldn’t be very prescriptive at all, other than to define universal qualities such as egalitarianism, altruism, strength of character, and so forth.

So I can't say I have a lot of concrete answers right now. My favorite way of "being a man" some days is [simply to poke fun at the whole concept](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite/114049028127172049).

At any rate, I appreciated Adam's video quite a lot, and then immediately reading that Pew study was icing on the cake.
