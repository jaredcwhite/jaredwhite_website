I sometimes feel bad it's been over two months and I haven't traveled farther to more "spectacular" inland wilderness areas. I've largely spent a heckuvalotta time just in coastal areas of Oregon and Northern California.

But why not? **I sincerely believe this is some of the most beautiful country you'll find anywhere in the world.** And town-hopping—checking out the local food scenes, libraries, stores, galleries, markets, etc.—is one of the most fun things to do ever.

I do have some "big" trips planned soon, such as going to the Colorado Rocky Mountains as well as Glacier National Park. But I'm not in a rush. Remember, the #NomadLifestyle isn't about where you eventually get to. It's about the life you are privileged to experience along the way.
