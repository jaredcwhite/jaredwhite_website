One of the good surprises so far in this shitshow of a year has been my realization that—somehow—I seem to have made peace with all of my past selves.

For Reasons™, I've been going through a lot of old memorabilia tucked away in closets and drawers, and unlike in times before when I've done so and felt feelings of anger, loss, or frustration, this time around I feel a tangible sense of acceptance. There's enough distance between me and the hurts of the past, and enough groundedness in who I am today…the complex product of all that I've done and all that my predecessors did before me…that I'm able to take everything I continue to love and appreciate from my copious life experiences and treasure those still, while leaving the dumb stuff behind where it belongs.

It has taken **a ton of work** for me to get to this point. My #spirituality has changed and evolved, I've studied meditation and #mindfulness, I've talked deeply with therapists and with close friends, and the journey isn't yet over of course. But I feel like, in a veracious way that is almost physical in nature, a significant chapter of my life has concluded and a brand new chapter is about to begin. And while that can be scary in a myriad of ways, **I am embracing it wholeheartedly**. _Let the festivities begin!_
