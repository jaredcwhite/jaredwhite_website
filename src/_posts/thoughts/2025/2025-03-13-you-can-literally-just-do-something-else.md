I will never understand the latent power that many people willingly give up, because somehow they've become convinced they lack the agency to design the kind of life they would prefer to live.

 Perhaps I'm just an oddly independently-minded person, with a high tolerance for nonconformance. "I just want to fit in and be accepted like everyone else" is a suit that I did try on for a while in my early adulthood and eventually found that it never fit my skull.

Virtually everyone I've ever personally admired has been *deeply eccentric* in unusual and unique ways. I'm not not sure why I ever thought I could get by not being an eccentric myself. I suppose it's natural when you're young to want to be part of a "tribe" that everyone else seems to be a part of and having a good time. You want to be in that club, not out of it. Only losers are out of the club.

The truth is that nobody inside the club is having fun either. It's a show. It's a performance. **It's a lie.**

Once you break free of that deception, once you shed the blind desire to conform, you discover that life on the other side is actually great. **The grass actually is greener.**
