title: It‚Äôs Not a Conspiracy Theory If They‚Äôre Doing It in Broad Daylight
tags: politics family
---

My kids are with me every other weekend. My youngest sort of just tunes out anything news-related, but my teen is a news junkie and always wants me to "spill the tea". And let me tell you: the top stories being covered by **DNN** (Daddy News Network) these days are **friggin' nuts**. üòµ‚Äçüí´

Every time I'm having to catch my teen up on a mere fraction of what's been going on in the past ~12 days, it's hard for me to believe the words spilling out of my mouth. It all sounds _batshit crazy_. I feel like I'm spouting off insane conspiracy theories. It sounds like speculative fiction written in a fever dream by an author who's been dropping acid much too frequently.

**Department of Government Efficiency**, or D.O.G.E, because _DOGE_ ha ha get it? ha ha. That doesn't sound like real life. That sounds like something you'd come across in a particularly screwy episode of _Helluva Boss_.

"Accidentally" firing hundreds of people overseeing the **NUCLEAR ARSENAL** of the United States of America‚Ä¶and then struggling to figure out _HOW TO CONTACT SOME OF THEM TO UN-FIRE THEM??!!?!_

This wouldn't even end up in a work of fiction. The editor would take a red pen to it because this stuff's not only far too outlandish, it sounds stupidly stupid and dumb, dumb, dumb. _So dumb._

I keep telling my teen this isn't #politics as usual under any circumstances. **I apologize, over and over again, that they're coming of age** in an age of sheer lunacy, idiocy, and fashy buffoonery‚Ä¶that the optimism of youthful Millennials believing they were ushering in a 21st Century filled with technological wonders, abundant resources, and pluralistic freedom in a spirit of inclusion had quickly‚Äîshockingly‚Äîgiven way to, well, the usual suspects of the dregs of history: **Greed. Lust for power. The strong preying on the weak. Mass propaganda. Regressivism.**

Astonishingly, my teen isn't phased. They've been through a lot already. You have no idea (and I don't feel it's my story to tell). But they're resilient, they're **out**, and oh yeah they're proud‚Äîthey were born a _fighter_.

Yes I'm a dad who is absolutely in awe of his children, and as a result my perspective is rapidly shifting. I no longer feel like I'm in this fight to restore dignity, secular humanism, and the rule of law to America because that's what I desire for myself‚ÄîI'm in this fight for my #family. **My kids deserve better than the world we're handing them.** And I'd better close with that because if I keep going _the tears they will flow_.

**Don't give up. RESIST.** ‚úä
