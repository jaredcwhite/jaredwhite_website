Welp, I dood it.

It's possible Developer Beta 3 will end up as a Public Beta shortly, but I just couldn't wait. Despite previously saying I'd hold out until the Public Beta cycle to upgrade my #iPhonePro, I decided to throw caution to the wind and go for it.

Look, I find the iOS 17 UI to be _supremely boring_ at this point (and I never went for v18 because it sucked). #Apple may still have a laundry list of tweaks to do before they get **Liquid Glass** dialed in just rightâ€¦but I'm so there already on my iPad and figured **YOLO**. ðŸ˜…

_So far so good!_
