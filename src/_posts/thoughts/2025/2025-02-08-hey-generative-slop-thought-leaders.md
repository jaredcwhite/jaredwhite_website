Hey Thought Leaders™, here's the *bare minimum* you could do to start meeting the **#**[ProCraft](https://indieweb.social/tags/ProCraft) movement half-way…

…Not even half-way really, but it would be a promising start.

Just admit your #generativeAI slop tools are simply that: tools. *Optional tools.* "Some people might find them helpful some of the time depending on the use case" is an argument I could at least respect, even if we still have a _mountain_ of ethical dilemmas to wade through.

But **cut the crap** with the frankly insane rhetoric about how this is "the future of everything" and will "revolutionize the globe" and has ushered in a "new age" and everyone has to get on board or be "left behind" as if we in the growing **#**ProCraft movement might as well still be riding around in buggies and listening to gramophones. And definitely, definitely don't spout blatantly wackadoo **#**AntiCraft statements like [people who compose and perform music don't actually enjoy composing and performing music](https://www.404media.co/ceo-of-ai-music-company-says-people-dont-like-making-music/).

You don't sound like smart people. **You don't.** You sound like fucking psychopaths. And we're pretty damn tired of it.

So *please*, for the love of god, **dial down the hype machine like 98%**, and let's have a civilized conversation. Because if you're not willing to do that, if you're going to go out on talk shows or head conferences and tell the gullible masses that "AGI is nearly here" and that [we'd all better get used to working alongside an "AI workforce" chatting with "AI agents" all day](/20250123/marc-benioff-artificial-slave-labor), either one of two things is true:

1. You're a lunatic, or
2. You're a carnival barker.

**Either way, shame on you.**
