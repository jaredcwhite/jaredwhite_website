‚ÄúTired and confused, yes I am  
Don't see much in the future for me  
I'm a vagabond and a drifter  
Not so hard to be  
Walking down the highway  
Walking through the park  
Looking out for something  
Still in the dark  
Don't know what to say when I see you smile  
So I guess I'll turn my head and go  
On the way to another mile‚Äù

[Passing Through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaO2i8b-xhw) has always been one of my favorite Bruce Hornsby songs from what is probably my favorite Bruce Hornsby album, _Harbor Lights_. It holds a special significance for me now that I've had many a #NomadLifestyle moment feeling too like a vagabond and a drifter. (Through a tad less depressed about it‚Ä¶)

I love this later section of the song:

‚ÄúWant faith in something  
So hard to believe  
Maybe one night soon  
Maybe you could make me see‚Äù

**So good.** üòå
