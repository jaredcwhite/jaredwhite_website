**Congratulations me!** ðŸŽ‰

I set a goal for myself at the beginning of this year to write a blog post every day. I am pleased to inform you that this very post marks the final post in my first third of the year 2025. I suppose it would have made more sense to mark the milestone of finishing up Q1 (Jan-Mar), but honestly, I forgot. ðŸ˜…

Plus I actually started this habit in early December last year as a trial run, so I'm really coming up on finishing month five of the experiment. But who's counting? (Me. I'm counting. ðŸ˜‚)

I have to say, **I feel pretty self-satisfied at reaching this milestone.** Although I did cover up one mishapâ€¦let's just say I _might_ have accidentally blown past the midnight deadline and backdated a post. But my lips are sealed. **You'll never know which oneâ€¦**

I wish I could say the twinge of panic right at the start of sitting down and #writing something has gone away. But it has certainly dulled. I've done this enough times to know there's _always_ something worthwhile to talk about. And I feel like I've truly grown in my ability to think on my feet, so to speak. **Jared White, Ace Reporter.** Imagine me furiously typing away on a mechanical keyboard, clackity-clack, having to bang out yet another salacious article at the last minute before going to press. _Yeah, I can't either._ I'm of the generation which never subscribed to an actual newspaperâ€¦

**Blogs 4 Life!** ðŸ™Œ

Anyway, I'm rambling now. **One third down. Two thirds to go.** Thank you and good nightâ€¦
