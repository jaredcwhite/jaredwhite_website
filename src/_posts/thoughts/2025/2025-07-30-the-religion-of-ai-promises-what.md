title: The Religion of AI Promises Its Followersâ€¦What, Exactly?
tags: generativeai

I posted the following on LinkedIn, so you don't have to. ðŸ˜‚

**Every AI booster on this website is working themselves out of their own livelihood. Think about it.**

If what they are saying is true, that #generativeAI capabilities are accelerating exponentially and we're going to reach AGI and even "superintelligence" within our immediate lifetimes, then there's no future role for them.

We'll have AI CEOs. AI CTOs. AI VPs. AI PMs. AI researchers, designers, developers, marketers, salespeople, and PR. AI turtles all the way down. An entire startup 100% run by AI! Even VCs will be AI!

Look, I'm not saying *I* believe all of this is going to happen. I'm saying if you believe the AI boosters, then *you* believe all of this is going to happen.

Do you? And if soâ€¦why are you excited about this? Do you think you're going to get paid a good salary forâ€¦cheering on the AIs doing all the labor? (We'll set aside the actual question of, um, who's paying for all this AI laborâ€¦)

Most religions promise eternal life or spiritual enlightenment or some sort of end transformational result which allows us to transcend the lowly estate we currently inhabit. I'm not really sure what the religion of AI promises. I doubt Zuck and Altman can give you a straight answer either. ðŸ˜‚
