[T.V. Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ald-VRw9h6w) is one of my favorite Joe Jackson songs, so I thought it'd be fun to update it a bit for the age we are all living in now, apparently. ðŸ˜Ž

So here you go: **A.I. Age!**

----

Here we stand  
(Prompt engineering keyboards in our sweaty little hands)  
As one man  
(We're lining up and waiting on ChatGPT's command)  

We don't move  
(We sent out for UberEats, get the news on social)  
I can prove  
(There's no need for web blogs, we got Instagram)  

**In the**  
**A.I. age**

A.I. rules  
(Pretty soon you won't be able to turn it off at all)  
All you fools  
(Then it'll turn you offâ€”your back's against the wall)

**In the**  
**A.I. age**
