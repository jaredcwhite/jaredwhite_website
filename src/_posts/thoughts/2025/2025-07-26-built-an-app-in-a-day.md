title: I Built a Web App in a Day
mono_styled: true

I just did something I haven't done in a very long time:

**I started a new app repo, set up a database, wrote a feature, and it works.** ðŸ¤¯ (And of course I'm using my [Bridgetown framework](https://edge.bridgetownrb.com) to write it inâ€”that is, the 2.0 version currently in beta which has new functionality for app devs).

The reason I was able to get to an MVP state (for me at least) in only a few hours is because I've spent literally months thinking about what I wanted to write, how I wanted to write it, and I had done some initial experiments on components that eventually I was able to pull in here.

In a way, this is the opposite of "vibe coding". _No vibes necessary!_ Since I had the entire symphony composed in my head already, I simply had to put pen to paper (so to speak) to write out the notes.

**"Fine Jared, we get it already. So when do we get to see it?!"**

_Patience, my friends._ There's still quite a ways to go before it's production-worthy, and even then it'll probably be a waitlisted beta for a while. But once I think I have something interesting to show off, I'll take some screenshots and talk more about it. **To whet your appetiteâ€¦this isn't "just" an app.** Think of it more like a web-based desktop. Once you "boot into the OS", you'll eventually have a variety of apps to choose from; all a bit quaint, very friendly, idiosyncratic, and above all, fun.

**This is simply the first one of the bunch.** ðŸ˜Ž
