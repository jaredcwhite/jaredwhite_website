Memory is such a funny thing. When you try to harken back to a past moment in time—perhaps a portion of your childhood, or halcyon days spent with a lover, or a special outing with friend—it's likely you don't simply remember those precise events as they unfolded, but rather how you may have _felt about them_ in a more recent timeframe. In other words, you remember your remembering, and that remembering may have also remembered a previous remembering…and so on. If we aren't careful, we can find ourselves having built up an elaborate edifice of sequenced memories.

That's one of the magical things about discovering old letters, or diary entries, or cards, or photographs, or videos. They can spark a fresh remembering, helping you enter back into that distant world without so much baggage and a flood of preconceived notions. Of course, those sorts of artifacts are never the _whole_ picture…they are inevitably missing a great deal of long-forgotten truths.

Sometimes it's enough just to **stop remembering** for a while. Close the door on some past events, let them air out and breathe. Time passes, you change and grow, and then when you decide you're ready to revisit those events, you'll have forgotten some of the more recent rememberings and you can access a more objective view of how you originally felt…what you originally experienced. In a way, it's a type of #mindfulness exercise.

Of course for those truly traumatic moments we don't ever wish to remember, perhaps it's best to leave the door closed permanently. But there may be other hard & difficult times for which, after we've cast aside those sequences of successive _frustrating_ rememberings, we're ready to take on a back-to-basics approach.

I've never been a very nostalgic person. I typically spend little effort delving into my own distant past, into my family's past. But as I've been doing that a fair degree lately, while clearing out old boxes of memorabilia, photographs, and writings, I've been pleasantly surprised at how much it has helped expand and _retexture_ my life's story.

**Memory is such a funny thing.**
