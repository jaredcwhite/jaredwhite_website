title: My First Four Weeks of Daily Blogging
tags: writing website
---

Well kids, I did it. I've concluded my first four weeksâ€”a month essentiallyâ€”of daily blogging. [I announced back on December 7](/20241207/daily-blogging-in-2025) this would be a major goal for me in 2025, and I actually started on it right then and there. So even though we're only on Day 4 of 2025, I've already gotten this #writing habit well underway.

In publishing regularly on this #website and elsewhere, I've come to a couple of conclusions thus far:

* **It's easier than I expected.** For such a "lofty" goal that I'd spent so long fantasizing about without hunkering down and just doing it, I'm rather amazed it's beenâ€”to put it plainlyâ€”a nothingburger. _OMG OMG OMG I'm going to become a daily blogger!_ ðŸ¥¹ And then suddenly you are andâ€¦OK? So where are the fireworks? Where are the balloons? It's so, it's soâ€¦ordinary? Huh. (And that, my friends, is the dark underbelly of content creation. There are no parades. "Nobody" cares. So you _really_ need to get your head on straight and find your [intrinsic motivation](/articles/3-vital-landmarks-on-road-to-success). "You HAVE to createâ€”because you CANâ€™T NOT create"â€”that's all there is to it.)
* **It's harder than I expected.** And by "harder" I meanâ€¦damn, I don't get to be lazy anymore. Do you think I _want_ to be writing this blog post right now on a rainy Saturday afternoon in January? _Hmm?!?!_ Seriously though, that relentless need to switch on your brain and come up with "the thing" that's worthy of being published that day is a lot. And writing isn't even a hard medium comparatively speakingâ€”I have absolutely **no idea** how people like Casey Neistat did _daily vlogging_ for all that time. Real quote: ["he had uploaded videos to his channel for 534 consecutive days"](https://mashable.com/article/youtube-casey-neistat-ends-vlog). Sheer insanity! And yetâ€¦I wish I could do that!!

So there you have it. A handful of thoughts after daily blogging for 29 consecutive days. **Here's to at least 361 more days!** ðŸ¥¹
