I'm sure I'll have more to say about this in future travelogue installments, but I just want to say that my ability to travel around the western United States and live this #NomadLifestyle is really only possible thanks to **libraries**. [As I said in a previous post](/20250422/how-i-work-as-a-digital-nomad), they are truly treasures of the common good and rare examples of public spaces open to all.

Growing up I always thought a library is a place where you can browse books and "rent" them, for lack of a better word. In other words, if a bookstore is a DVD store, a library is a Blockbuster. (I'm really dating myself here. ðŸ˜…)

But libraries have evolved to become essentially the "Free Internet CafÃ©" of most towns. And the importance of that cannot be overstated. These are veritable community centers which don't just cater to people like me with some measure of resources but to people who might not have much to their name in this world.

Any time I hear about libraries being denigrated in the news by some chuckleheaded buffoon, I want to gnash my teeth in frustration. **Libraries are amazing! Libraries are incredible!** And I wish I were more into reading books so I could actually enjoy reading books at the library. ðŸ˜¬ But give me a nice desk or table, decent WiFi, and a power outlet, and I am the happiest camper ever. ðŸ˜Œ
