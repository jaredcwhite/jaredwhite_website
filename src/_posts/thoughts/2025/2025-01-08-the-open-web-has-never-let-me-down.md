[Recent events](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338127/meta-end-fact-checking-misinformation-zuckerberg) online have been [truly sucky](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338125/meta-mark-zuckerberg-fact-checking-censorship-brendan-carr-trump), but as always the one shining light has been the #openweb (and by extension, the #fediverse—run by independent operators of course).

Virtually everything I hate, _hate_ about the modern Internet has less to do with the design and featureset of the Web technically-speaking and much more to do with the fact that increasingly people are only accessing a mere handful of domain names as filtered through a mere handful of apps. I'll go a step further: even while online spaces dominated by Big Tech slide further into hellscape territory, it's _never_ been easier for plucky individuals to build amazing experiences for the Web. The capabilities of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a plethora of cheap/free hosting options are so incredible today, my brain would have melted 10 years ago—certainly 20 years ago—if I'd been shown this kind of raw power.

And therein lies the disconnect…never before has **The Indie Web** been such a glorious platform for building anything you might dream of and sharing it with anyone you like, yet never before has **The Corporate Web** been so awful and damaging to the body politic.

I wish I knew how to deal with this _cognitive dissonance_, and how to convey to mere mortals out there that **The Indie Web** is alive and kicking and that **The Corporate Web** doesn't have to define their experience of being online. This seems to be _the challenge_ of 2025, and not a single day goes by when I don't think deeply about this problem. It's mentally and emotionally taxing—but again, I'm grateful to know there are others out there in the same boat. _We've got our work cut out for us, that's for sure!_
