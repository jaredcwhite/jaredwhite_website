I didn't notice when this happened recently, but continuing the trend of my #Fediverse powered social profiles being more successful than I ever was in corporate silos, my [Pixelfed account](https://pixelfed.social/essentiallife) now has more followers than I _ever_ had back in the day on Instagram. üôå

Not only that, because of the blessings of federation, I can boost posts I publish on Pixelfed through my Mastodon profile(s), thus increasing reach even more. That's as if back in _ye olde days_ I could have "retweeted" my Instagram photos directly to my Twitter followers.

I know there are lots of people who were orders of magnitude more successful than I ever was on corporate silos, so maybe Fedi just can't offer them an alternative that's appealing enough. But me? **I wouldn't trade this amazing new world for anything.** üòç
