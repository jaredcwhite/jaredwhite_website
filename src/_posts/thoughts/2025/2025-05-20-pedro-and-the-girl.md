I just finished watching that one where Pedro Pascal has to brave the perils of a hostile environment all while protecting the orphan girl in his care from the dangers which lurk around every corner.

Nope, not [the one you're thinking of](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/100088-the-last-of-us). [The other one!](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/506072-prospect)

Yes indeed, _Prospect_ completely passed me by back in 2018 when it came out, but I happened to be on Tubi and noticed a cast centered around Pedro and Sophie Thatcher (who has proven to be thoroughly outstanding in the more recent productions of _Heretic_ and _Companion_). Count me in!

While I won't go so far as to say it's a standout in the pantheon of #scifi #movies, I quite enjoyed the watch and was amazed at how compelling a film like this could be with so little of the whiz-bang special effects you normally expect to see in the genre. I was also chuckling that the "alien landscape" was shot on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. **Sure, I guess you could say the Pacific Northwest is out of this world!**

Definitely worth the watch if you haven't seen it yetâ€”especially since it's free (with ads) on Tubi. I hope the indie filmmaking team is able to secure the funding necessary to [continue this IP aka "The Fringe" in future projects](https://www.fringedrifters.com).
