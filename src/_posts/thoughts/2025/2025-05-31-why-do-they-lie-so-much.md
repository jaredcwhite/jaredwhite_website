title: Why Do They Lie So Much?
---

It's not "storytelling". It's not being a "visionary". It's not painting a picture, imagining tomorrow today, or any other bullshit euphemism they want throw at you.

**It's lying.**

Why do the tech bros and oligarchs and influencers lie so much? They lie, lie, and then lie some more. Day in, and day out—lies, lies, lies.

_An edifice of lies._

It'd be breathtaking if it weren't so dastardly.

I really wonder sometimes at the journalists—yes, even the good ones—who are in the position to talk to these people. Why do they ask them reasonable questions, get inundated with lies, and then move on?

If I were the interviewer, I'd have just a few simple questions:

1. **Why do you lie so much?**
2. Why are you telling even more lies in this very interview?
3. Why is it that so many people believe your lies?
4. Do _you_ actually believe your own lies at this point, or are you fully aware of all the lies you tell?
5. When experts repeatedly expose your lies for what they are, do you feel anything? Anything at all?

But we all know journalists won't do that. Because then they'll be out of a job.

**I don't blame them. Not really.** The entire system is rotten from top to bottom. But I can't help but wonder if, like me, they are crawling out of their skin on the inside—and unlike me, simply much better at hiding it.
