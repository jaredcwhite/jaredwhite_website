title: Become Who Your Homepage Was Born to Be

The most incredible thing about the World-Wide Web is that you can publish _whatever you want_ on your own **homepage** on your own **domain**.

You can literally just start publishing on `iamthemostinterestingpersoninthe.world` and say _whatever it is you wish to say_. ðŸ¤¯

It's important to realize that this capability did not exist in human civilization until roughly thirty years ago. Before that, sure, you could publish a paper pamphlet, a "zine", something tangible. But who's going to read it? Who's going to care? And how many of those people could you ever hope to reach at all?

I understand it can be hard at times to remain bright-eyed about #Website publishing & communication when in the past thirty years we've also witnessed the explosion of hate speech, misinformation, and slop. Free speech sure gets messy; what's even worse, some platforms will abuse the concept of "free speech" by engaging in capricious and damaging moderation actions which _elevate_ hate and _punish_ minorities and marginalized peoples.

There's a lot of work to do to combat this. **And I am by no means naÃ¯ve.**

But I hope we never lose sight of the unsurpassed wonder and joy we can _only_ get from the Web's open rangeâ€”not beholden to any single company, any single country, any single tribe or creed.

In my article [Why Homepages Matter in 2018](/articles/why-homepages-matter-in-2018), I wrote the following:

> If the blog is a dying artform, so be it. Iâ€™d rather be the last man standing who has a real personal homepage than hand over my online lifestyle to a company who has shown utter contempt for user privacy and data integrity.

The company in question here was Facebook, recently embroiled in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The bad news is, Facebook/Meta is still alive and kicking in 2025. The **good news** is, it has been shown to wield _far less power_ over how people live and work and recreate and thrive than we might have once assumed. Many people have walked away from Facebook, walked away from Instagram. We have new platforms, new protocols, and new tools at our disposal.

And that's the beauty of the Web. It's ever-changing, evolving, growing, and adapting. Things may seem to _really, really suck_ in the now, but the moral arc of the digital universe bends towards digital justice.

**That is what I believe.** I have toâ€¦the alternative is far too dismal to contemplate.

_TL;DR: HOMEPAGES RULE!!_ ðŸ¤˜
