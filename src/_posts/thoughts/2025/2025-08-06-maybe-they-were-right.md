We should have placed more trust in our ancestors for whom history was unkind…until now, when perhaps it's time for a _second look_.

* **We should have trusted** those who feared the advent of what became "conventional" produce & factory farming techniques. The path back to organic produce and sustainable agriculture was long and difficult, and in fact remains a constant challenge.
* **We should have trusted** those who were [apprehensive of automobile manufacturers](/20250517/maybe-automation-is-like-bad) causing mayhem in our streets—killing children, polluting the atmosphere, and destroying human-scale town centers. Decades of poor urban design is now having to be reversed in a frantic effort to combat a housing crisis and catastrophic climate change.
* **We should have trusted** those who were concerned that the rise of television and 24/7 access to video footage of all sorts could give rise to extremist propaganda and the intellectual enslavement of millions.
* **We should have trusted** those who claimed there was little daylight between the aspirations of religious extremists living in "foreign lands" and the growing ranks of conservative zealots found right here in our domestic fabric.
* **We should have trusted** those who refused to use new computer platforms & services sold by hypergrowth megacorps for fear that soon all of our data and day-to-day activities would be beholden to a vanishingly tiny number of companies and their government cronies.
* **We should have trusted** those who warned us about the dangers of social media conglomerates forming digital borders around public discourse and the sharing of news. We could have taken steps decades ago to kneecap these monopolies. Now the very future of _democracy_ is at risk.

And now, **we must trust those who are sounding the alarm** over the myriad of dangers which generative agentic AI poses to our collective mental health, creativity, politics, and workers' rights.

Because **history is repeating itself** right in front of our very eyes. _Are we going to let it?_
