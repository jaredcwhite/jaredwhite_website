**Sometimes art needs to be angry.**

I consider a lot of the art I've experienced (or made!) over the years and so much of it has trended towards the serene or the cerebral or the celebratory. Hell, my first solo album was literally called [Garden Journey](https://yarred.bandcamp.com/album/garden-journey) and was inpired by meditation & massage music.

And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying art that's romantic or relaxing or comical or whimsical or joyful or merely decorative is bad or "lesser than".

But I'm at a moment in my lifeâ€”and a moment in the _zeitgeist_â€”when I'm longing for art that **rattles**. Art that shakes, confronts, confounds, and condemns. Art that is fearless, raw, offensive. **Art that raises a fist and takes a stand.**

I'm not saying we should all dye our hair purple, listen to death metal, or set cars on fire. Remember, capitalism has a way of absorbing even critques of its own system, leading you to "sell out" even as you decry being a sellout. It's _insidious_ in that way.

What I _am_ saying is as people who believe in more than empty, self-absorbed materialism; who truly do care about a #spirituality which requiresâ€”nay, _demands_â€”a deep and relentless drive to fight for social justice and leaving the world in better shape than how you found it; it is _incumbent_ upon us to seek out as well as create artifacts which **move the needle** in some concrete manner and **wake** audiences the _fuck up_. (aka STAY WOKE! ðŸ˜…)

Are you with me on this? I'm just not finding myself drawn to the typical pablum. I am expecting more from the creators I look up to and admireâ€”**and I am trying to push myself this year in the same way.**
