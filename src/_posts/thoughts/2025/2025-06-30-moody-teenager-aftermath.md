I'm the kind of tired only the parent of a moody teenager feels.

Yes, we had a bit of a meltdown moment on our hands earlier today. My teen is feeling lots of **big feelings** and I totally get it. I really do. And I _love_ that they are still willing to open up to me about their hopes and fears.

At the same time, #parenting isn't a switch. I can't simply "turn on" being a sympathetic sensitive dad to help them go through all the things they're going through, and then later "turn off" and I'm a perfectly OK me once more. Now _I'm feeling big feelings too_ andâ€¦wellâ€¦it's not easy. ðŸ˜…

And that's all I have to say about that because I need to go to sleep now. ðŸ« ðŸ˜´ðŸ’¤
