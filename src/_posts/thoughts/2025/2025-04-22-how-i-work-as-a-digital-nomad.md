title: How I Work as a Digital Nomad
tags: nomadlifestyle freelancing

A short addendum to [Part I of my Travelogue](/articles/a-nomads-pnw-travelogue-part-i):

I realize I didn't mention much about what I'm doing for work as I live the #NomadLifestyle. I'm doing the same thing I've already been doing for years, #freelancing as a software developer for my boutique web studio [Whitefusion](https://www.whitefusion.studio).

**Working on the go isn't anything new for me.** I had gone on short "digital nomad" excursions on a regular basis long before hitting the road full-time. It's been a matter for pride for me that I can work in almost any conceivable environment. I've worked in:

{: .tighter}
* Planes
* Trains
* Automobiles
* Parks
* Mountaintops
* Libraries
* Boats
* Steps Behind a Building
* Coworking Spaces
* Cafés
* Pubs
* AirBnBs
* Hotels
* Grocery Stores
* Beaches
* Churches
* Conventions
* Next to a Creek
* Athletic Clubs
* And Yes, Home Offices

In a certain sense, that last option is the least appealing to me which is why I never fully resonated with the concept _Work From Home_. For me, _Remote Work_ has always had little real overlap per se with WFH. I could literally head into an office every day and "work a 9 to 5" — and yet it's remote work. In fact, I've done exactly that at times when I've had a membership or even a dedicated desk at a particular coworking space.

Remote work and also being a digital nomad to me simply means that nobody is dictating the _how_ of my getting the job done. **They simply evaluate the merits of the outcome.** Whether that outcome was obtained because I did some work at an office desk or because I did some work in a yurt in the middle of the woods is completely beside the point. I'm very thankful I'm able to make a living—challenging certainly in this crazy Tech Industry season we're in—as a remote worker.

With regards to the journey I'm currently on, I definitely have to manage some logistics at times around where I'll be able to find a decent cell signal or Wi-Fi. Starbucks has certainly saved my butt now and again. I ended up joining the "Sip Club" at Panera Bread which has also been very helpful when I'm in major urban centers. **Independent coffee shops in all sorts of out-of-the-way places are always a blessing.** Some nicer grocery stores with seating have also worked wonders. And any chance I get, **I always seek out a local library**. They are truly treasures of the common good and rare examples of public spaces open to all.

But sometimes I've simply sat in my car seat with a little attachment that fits over the steering wheel to provide me with a "desk" for my laptop while using my iPhone's Personal Hotspot feature. T-Mobile has been pretty good to me a decent amount of the time.

I could greatly level up my "off-grid" work opportunities if I purchased Starlink, but do I want to hand a single penny over to Space Karen? _Aw HELL naw!_ So I make do.

That's pretty much the gist of it. Have more questions about how I'm working on the road? [Feel free to ping me on Mastodon!](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite)
