We should have listened to Stevie Nicks.

Last year, [she released this powerful call to action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJDCYh5iWQs). We should have listened to her. We should have fought harder.

**I just pray it's not too late.**

**The Lighthouse (excerpt)**

I have my scars, you have yours  
Don't let them take your power  
Don't leave it alone in the final hours  
They'll take your soul, they'll take your power  
Unless you stand up and take it back  
Try to see the future and get mad  
It's slipping through your fingers, you don't have what you had  
You don't have much time to get it back

In the midnight hour, they'll slam the door  
Make you forget what you were fighting for  
Put you back in your place, they'll shut you down  
You better learn how to fight, you better say it out loud
