I understand that, when you are staring at a factory spewing toxic chemicals and carbon into the atmosphere, someone who shuffles over and whispers in your ear "_Go plant a tree and save the world_"; your first instinct isn't to thank them for their keen insight but to launch a broadside in their direction.

And yet…in twenty years the factory could be thoroughly reformed or closed for good, and meanwhile, **you played an instrumental role in growing a forest**.

We are in the "planting trees" era of American #politics and #openweb technology right now. It will take a whole lot of effort and feel silly or pointless at times…and there will be moments when the desired future for our society seems farther away than ever before.

Don't let the temptation of bitter despair take hold. _Go plant a tree and save the world._ **Future generations are counting on you to do right by them.**
