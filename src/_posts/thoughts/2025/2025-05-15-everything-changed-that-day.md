title: Everything Changed That Day

It's curious how most days are "just another day"—even if you happen to have a particularly jovial or even noteworthy time—and then every once in a great while you have A Day to Remember. A day when **everything changes** (hopefully for good and not ill).

It's particularly curious to me how much my present life can be traced back to two specific days within the past year. I think about these two days—one last summer and one at the start of this year—on a regular basis. If I told you what happened on these days, it wouldn't sound like much.

One of the days, I went on a long walk late at night along the Willamette River in Portland.

Another one of the days, I sat in my car in a parking lot in Lincoln Beach and stared at the Pacific Ocean.

In both those cases, something profound shifted within my psyche. _I was affected by the universe._ There was a fork in the road…even if I didn't fully understand that yet.

I am amazed by days like this. Whenever they come along, **treasure them.**
