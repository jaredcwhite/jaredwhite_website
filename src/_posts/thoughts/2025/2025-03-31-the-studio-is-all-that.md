Seth Rogen is one of my absolute favorite stars ever. He's the good Rogen (not the bad Rogan). He's my spirit guide. He can do no wrong.

I give you that preamble because it's hard for me to imagine him doing anything I truly hate. (Granted, there's a ton of Rogen backcatalog I haven't seen yet…I'm sure there's a stinker or two.) I went into _The Studio_ already expecting to love it. Certainly the buzz and the hype surrounding this project has been superlative indeed—another one of the great Apple TV+ #tvshows apparently.

I just finished the first episode. And I didn't love it.

**I LOVED IT.** 🙌 👏👏

As always when you're this early on in a season of television, you must prepare yourself to be disappointed at _some_ point. Not every episode can be _great_. But if this show keeps up much in the same vein as how it started? I'm prepared to call this a **smash hit**. And I simply cannot wait to continue watching _The Studio_ and laughing so hard I have to pause playback for a solid 20 seconds.

(Oh Yeah! 😉)
