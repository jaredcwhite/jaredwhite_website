Literally read this quote on some goofbrained dude's LinkedIn post about his high-flying CTO buddy's claim that: "Anyone can move from Bootstrap to React now" and that "Technical debt cleanup is going to India for pennies on the dollar" thanks to #GenerativeAI and **I truly believe** the industry I have worked in for the last 30 years has become fucking untethered from any semblance of sanity and reality.

And as a commenter put it, wow this sure is insulting against Indian developers!

**P.S.** I've been hired for more than one project in the past to come in and completely redo what was poorly implemented previously by an "outsourced" dev firm. I'm not saying that to be insulting either, it's just a point that outsourcing as a concept has _never_ been a good idea. Here is the answer: _hire talented people_, no matter where they're located, pay them well, and build a real team based on good principles of high-quality creative collaboration. **Don't be a dick!**
