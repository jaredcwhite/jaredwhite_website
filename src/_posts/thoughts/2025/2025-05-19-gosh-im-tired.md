Gosh, I'm tired. Exhausted.

A lot of _stuff_ has happened to me in the past few days. Some very good stuff, but also some veryâ€”uhâ€”not good stuff. The kind of stuff which would really affect my mental health in a negative way if I hadn't built up a whole ton of #mindfulness mojo (that's the medical term for it, dontchaknow!) from my many recent travels & hikes through nature wilderness areas.

I have never had to be so "grounded" in my inner life as right now. The world seems to have gone utterly, utterly mad. **I get very little peace from any externalities right now.** If I am to be at peace, I must summon it from withinâ€”and from the rocks and the trees and the streams and the grass and the sky. _You'd better believe I'm even doing hippie-dippie shit like holding crystals._ Yeah, crystals! ðŸ’Ž

**It's come to this.** ðŸ˜‚

What are your mindfulness / meditation / spiritual practices you like to do to remain grounded and find inner peace? I'd love it if you would comment via Mastodon (link below) and let me know!
