title: Oh Calm Down, It's Just a…

I have always had the greatest respect for people who are deeply passionate about something esoteric.

I don't even personally need to care about what they care about. I'll admire them anyway just for their passion. I once knew someone who was passionate about the fine art of making reeds for bagpipes. He didn't even play bagpipes very well, but he was a hell of a reed maker. It had never occurred to me there could be a person out there who doesn't really play the bagpipes yet cares about how to make bagpipe reeds.

What a strange passion to have right? And yet **I would never dream of wading into a heated conversation** about the best way to make a bagpipe reed, or how to form the shape of a bellows, or what type of leather to use for a strap, and say _"calm down, it's only just a…"_

**How disrespectful. How rude. How ignorant.**

My rule of thumb: never walk up to a master of their craft and tell them what they should or should not be concerned about when it relates to their craft. It only serves to illustrate the poverty of your own mind.

A very close second to this is when people come along and say, in so many words, _nobody cares how the sausage is made_. This comes up in programming circles _all the time_ for some odd reason. "No user cares" how XYZ language/tool/framework/library/technique was employed in the production of this app, supposedly. They just care if it works to meet their perceived end goal.

[I once recorded a whole podcast episode thoroughly rejecting this sad and misguided notion.](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/56/)

People _will_ care about your craft because **it's your job to make them care**.

Me, I care _deeply_ about how other people make the things that I use. I may not understand much of what they say about how they build what they build, how they design what they design. _It doesn't matter!_ The point is that **I respect their craft**. I respect their ingenuity and unique #creativity.

I care about what they care about because _I admire how much they care about it_.
