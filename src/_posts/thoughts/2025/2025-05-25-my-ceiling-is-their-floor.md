I don't post much about #parenting onlineâ€¦in fact it appears I haven't used that tag here since 2018! (I've talked about #family since, I just didn't use the other tag).

So permit me, if you will, to indulge in a _proud papa_ moment. I was with the kids (teen and preteen) doing a fair bit of logistical maneuvering todayâ€”carrying heavy objects, trying to fit weirdly-shaped stuff into the car, figuring out how to solve problems of a mechanical nature, etc.

And for the first time, I didn't feel like I was constantly having to instruct them what to do, and furthermore we often weren't even at intellectual parity to be honest. **They were giving me ideas** and coming up with novel solutions to problems I hadn't figured out yet.

In other words, it's now clear that occasionally I'm a doofus and **my kids are geniuses.** ðŸ˜‚

But seriouslyâ€”nothing is more sweet to a parent (the good ones anyway) than, after running for so long, savoring the privilege of watching the next generation soar. I truly wish that my kids will be smarter, more talented, more successful, and **more awesome in every respect** than myself. Honestly I would have settled for "I didn't totally mess them up for life"â€¦this is a far better outcome. ðŸ˜œ
