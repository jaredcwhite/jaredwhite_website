At its best, long-term travel functions as a sort of **sieve**.

It filters out the parts of yourself which are just not as important as you fancied them to be, which then allows the essence of who you really are shine forth all the more clearly.

I have been surprised now that I'm several months into the #NomadLifestyle just how much I "don't care" about certain things which were really gnawing at me, and at the same time how much I still do care about other things. Seeing how my priorities have shifted has been incredibly illuminating, and while sometimes you can get a _taste_ of that effect with short-term travel (a weekend getaway for example), I really do think **"directionless travel"** over an appreciable length of time (so not a "vacation" in the strict sense of the word) is _unparalleled_ in its ability to reshape your mind, body, and soul.

**I highly recommend it.** ðŸ˜Š
