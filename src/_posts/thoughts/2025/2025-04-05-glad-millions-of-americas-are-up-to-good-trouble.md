I'm glad millions of Americans were up to "good trouble" today.

I'm also glad at how _organic_ the outrage feels. There were questions around why we weren't seeing mass protests across the country around the time of the Trump 2.0 inauguration. I think it was because people were simply _exhausted_, and also it's harder to protest what hasn't "happened" yet. We're now 75 days into the second Trump presidency, and **oh wow do we know what's been happening at this point**. üòµ

Protests went on *everywhere* today‚Äîeven in some rather sleepy 'burbs. An old Northern California friend [shared this article](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/hands-off-santa-rosa-napa-sonoma/) about protests happening in my ol' stompin' grounds of Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Cotati, Sonoma, Napa, and beyond. I'm quite astonished, truth be told.

From the article:

> Jora Gilmore attended the Courthouse Square protest with her mom, Autumn, her husband, Evan, and her 3-year-old son, Otis, who has cerebral palsy.
> 
> Gilmore said her son is on Medical and Medicaid because of his disability.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe are here to support disabled children,‚Äù Gilmore said. ‚ÄúIt is such a broad protest but we thought we can make it specific and advocate for health care and special education.‚Äù
> 
> Otis‚Äô wheelchair was adorned with two signs ‚Äî one that read ‚ÄúHands off my healthcare‚Äù and the other said ‚ÄúHands off special education.‚Äù
> 
> Gilmore said she believes Saturday‚Äôs protests were just the beginning.
> 
> ‚ÄúIf they are going to take us back to an authoritarian regime, we are going to give them a wild revolution,‚Äù she said.

And this really articulates well why so many people are protesting. The idiotic "culture wars" over trans athletes or corporate DEI hires or whatever the flying fuck MAGA is droning on about in that next soundbite only serve to obscure the fact that Trump and his billionaire cronies are **plundering our institutions** and **leveling civic infrastructure to the ground**. This isn't just about the usual #politics of one side of the aisle vs. the other. It's about decent people getting the shaft at the hands of assholes and imbeciles who cynically claimed to be "for the people" when nothing could be further from the truth.

**America is finally awake.** And MAGA's days are numbered.
