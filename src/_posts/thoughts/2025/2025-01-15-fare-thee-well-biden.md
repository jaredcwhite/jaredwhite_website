I tuned into the final presidential address by Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the American people.

**I tuned out after a few minutes.**

And therein lies the unfortunate legacy of this administration. Perhaps unparalleled in modern history has been this president's impact on the lives of every day Americans, making their lives substantially better in a myriad of key ways—and at the same time, **so little impact on the hearts and minds of these same people**. Biden was an anachronism the moment he stepped into office—a politician forged in an era which was rapidly fading from view. Yes, as many pundits (including myself) were keen to point out, Biden is only a few years older than Donald Trump. Yet somehow, in some fashion, Trump felt "of the times"—times being that we live in a world transformed by Twitter, by YouTube, by TikTok, by #politics being reduced to nothing more than rapid soundbites, savage texts, and "owns". Biden still lived in the world of _60 Minutes_.

And even when he made his generous, noble act of stepping away from the limelight in the 2024 race to give Kamala Harris a real shot at winning the thing, he doomed her to repeat the same error: assuming that the way Americans get their news and collectively process what's going on in the world around them was to trust _journalists_, trust _institutions_, and trust _traditions_.

Hate to break it to ya, but Americans in 2025 **don't give a fuck** about "journalists", "institutions", and "traditions". The old ways are dying…some are already dead. And MAGA is gloating that it gladly wielded the knife.

I fear for our future—not because I think Trumpism is all-powerful. Trumpism, as just another two-bit fascist ideology, contains legitimate weakness at the heart of it all. That's _why_ it must remain so noisy, all the time. **The grift must never end.**

No, rather I fear that the institutionally-minded Democrats are unable to grapple with this new reality. They expect business-as-usual in Washington, D.C. They assume in 2026 or 2028, there will _still be_ a 60 Minutes for a candidate to appear on. They assume the delicate balance between various branches of governments, departments, committees, and lobbyists will continue in a similar vein to what has occurred before.

I just don't know if Democrats understand Trumpism's true agenda: which is to tear everything down to the studs and rebuild an entirely new world order. And by the time the Dems _finally_ get it through their thick skulls…**I fear it will be too late.**

I'm not saying all of this is Biden's fault. Yet Biden represents that wing of the Democratic Party which failed to meet this moment. **It's a shame, it really is.** Because the truth our collective amnesia failed to grasp is that, on a pure domestic policy review, President Biden was one of the great leaders across the entire history of the United States.

And thus I salute you sir. **Thank you for your service.**

(And now the next four years begin. _May God have mercy on our souls_.)
