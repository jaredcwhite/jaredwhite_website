_Star Wars: Andor_ is a triumph, outstanding, sublime in its perfection. It not only does the job of elevating the #scifi genre as one of Disney+'s prestige #tvshows, it transcends genre and becomes a work of art…a G.O.A.T. Not since the original _Star Wars_ film and its even more impressive sequel _The Empire Strikes Back_ have we seen quality of this caliber. There, I said it. This is the best we've seen out of Lucasfilm since _Empire_. **Boom.**

When the Season 1 finale aired, [I wrote the following:](/links/20221211/andor-is-the-best-star-wars-since-the-last-jedi)

> Perhaps _Andor_ won’t be to everyone’s taste across the broader fandom, but I can tell you right now: THIS is the kind of Star Wars I like. **More please.**

And more we did indeed get with an incredible epic Season 2. I will say it started out a bit slow, but the momentum kept building and building and never stopped until the closing credits.

It's strange: I must admit I wasn't a huge fan of _Rogue One_ when it came out. I enjoyed it. [But I didn't love it.](/articles/my-top-5-scifi-films-of-2016)

I very much look forward to a rewatch now that so much backstory has been laid down. I hope I enjoy it more, but I fear no matter what it won't quite reach the heights of its chronological predecessor.

No matter. _Andor_ stands on its own: two seasons of some of the best television I have ever seen. Well done, Kathleen Kennedy, Tony Gilroy, and crew. **This is one for the history books.**
