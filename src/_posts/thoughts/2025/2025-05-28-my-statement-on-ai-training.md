Somehow [I missed this](aitrainingstatement.org) when it first came online last fall, but it's grown by several tens of thousands of signatories since then, and **I have added my name to the list**.

It's a very simple statement, a clarion call against the industrial theft that is happening due to #GenerativeAI training:

> “The unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI is a major, unjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted.”

_A-fucking-men._ (Also in case you're reading this, **I do not license ANY of my creative works for use in training generative AI.**)

Lots of famous artists and thinkers on the list, quite a few I'm sure you know of. I recommend [scrolling through the list](https://www.aitrainingstatement.org/signatories) a while. These are real people with tremendous creativity they have put forth into the world. It's despicable to think their blood, sweat, and tears might get (and let's be honest, probably already have gotten) slurped up and regurgitated back out again as _slop_ against their will. **It has to stop.**
