title: Well If It’s Entertainment You’re Kraven…

I haven't had the slightest bit of interest in the weird phenomenon that is the [SSU](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony%27s_Spider-Man_Universe) (Sony's Spider-Man Universe). I never saw any of the Venom films. Never saw Madame Web. And it's definitely not *Morbin' Time* for me.

But then I started hearing some buzz around the footage Sony released recently directly from the start of *Kraven the Hunter*, so I gave it a look and what I saw impressed me. The story genuinely sounded interesting, and Aaron-Taylor Johnson is a beautiful, beautiful man.

So I headed out to my local movie theater and watched *Kraven the Hunter*.

Is this a great film? No. Is it an extraordinary #scifi superhero romp? Also no. Is it fun & entertaining if you're ready to simply switch your brain off and enjoy the ride for a couple hours? **Very much so!**

I had a good time with it, and I think it _could_ have been an excellent movie in the hands of more competent filmmakers. The action was quite exciting, and I liked all the *actors*. The *acting*, however, fell flat at times (though I was riveted every time Russell Crowe was onscreen!￼), and the story—while compelling in the abstract—didn't adequately drive the narrative forward scene-to-scene.

Still, I'd recommend you go see it if you have nothing better to do and there aren't any other #movies at the cinemas vying for your attention. **True story:** I got to chatting with a dude out in the hallway while exiting the theater, and when I asked him what he thought of it, he said he liked it a lot.

I have a feeling this is going to be a slow but steady burn at the box office, and we'll be surprised at the numbers when all is said and done.
