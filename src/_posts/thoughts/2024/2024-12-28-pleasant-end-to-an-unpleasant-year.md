My brother is in town, because hey-o, my life completed another revolution around the sun recently. (Yup, I'm a December baby.) So me and kids and their uncle have all been gallivanting around #Portland today, and the city feels cute and cozy. I must say it's a **very pleasant end** to what has been a very unpleasant year in many respects.

I'll be coming out with my "hopes for 2025" spiel soon, but for now, I'm sincerely grateful to be surrounded by family and appreciating the place where I live.
