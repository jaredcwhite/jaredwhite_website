My mother passed away nearly 20 years ago. I still miss her. **A lot**.

But as I was in the car chatting with my kids about our own ages and growing older as a #family is wont to do, it occurred to me that if my mother were still alive, she'd be 73 years old. And the notion of having a 73-year-old "Mom" suddenly struck me as absurdist, loony, perhaps even a little frightening.

**I have no idea** what a 73-year-old _Mom_ would be like! And would _I even like her_, the way I did when she was in her 50s and I was in my 20s?

And that idea made me giggle a little. It's easier to miss her now, because I miss her in a special way I simply wouldn't if she were different, older, and here.
