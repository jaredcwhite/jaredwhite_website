_Noooooo! My day is ruined!!! Why me?? Why now?!!_ ðŸ˜«ðŸ’¢

We all have those moments. You're going about your day, minding your own business, feeling good about your "adulting" skills, and then a cascade of events begins to unfold which leaves your scheduled FUBARed and your composure in tatters.

Here's the thing though. Your "good day" was an illusion to begin with. You had deluded yourself into thinking you had it all together. It was taking an extraordinary amount of effort to "adult" in the first place, and as soon as bottom fell out of your routine, it was time for such magical thinking to dissipate.

**This is actually an improvement.** Your freakout is a sign that you had failed to do what you should have done from the start, which is to prepare for the truth: you'll encounter minor setbacks _all the time_. And on occasion, though we wish it were otherwise, a major setback.

The worthy challenge isn't to delude yourself into thinking you'll be able to avoid these bumps in the road. It's to _expect_ them. The faster you are willing to engage with them, face them head-on, and then **move on** to whatever may happen next, the more you will discover they tend to fade from view quickly and with little fuss.

I had my freakout moment earlier today. Now, as I write this, it's water under the bridge. **Problem solved.** Was my schedule interrupted? Sure. Is that upsetting in the moment? Sure. Will I have to make up for lost time over the next few days? Yes.

ðŸ‘‰ Did I shamelessly turn this shitshow into content for my blog just so I can hit my daily blogging quota? **Absol-fucking-lutely.** _Never let a crisis go to waste._ ðŸ˜¼ #lifehacks
