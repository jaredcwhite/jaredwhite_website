I'm trying to get back into the habit of posting short thoughts here on my blog and linking to them from Mastodon, rather than simply writing on Mastodon directly. And taking a page from other nerds in the blogosphere, I figured I'd experiment with using my favorite monospaced font, [Mononoki](http://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/). Will that help my new habit stick? We'll see!
