I'm changing my shopping habits. **I'm buying local.** I'm going to go radical on this.

I rarely buy anything online as it is, and that's been true for a while now. I'd already resolved to boycott Amazon, and at this point I don't feel too good supporting Shopify either (though that's different in that many independent online retailers use Shopify for their e-commerce websites).

But when I talk about going radically local, I don't mean just going to a local store even if they're a Big Box retailer. I mean buying things _made_ locally. Right here in #Portland.

Every day I carry my iPad and other gear in a backpack made locally. (So local in fact, I can walk to the manufacturer/storefront from my house in 5 minutes. ðŸ˜‚) And that's just the beginning. My next clothing purchase will be locally-made. I'll start with shirts because that's pretty straightforward and see where it goes from there.

And I love shopping at locally-owned markets and will prioritize food items from local suppliers.

If MAGA wants to claim with a straight face they're "America First", I'm here to tell you I'm "Oregon First". Call it my little act of political rebellionâ€¦ âœŠâ˜­
