Two years ago today, IT HAPPENED. The worst timeline. Something that I really didn't expect would actually come to fruition‚Ä¶_did_.

**Elon Musk's buyout offer for Twitter was officially accepted.** ü§°

[As I wrote two years ago today:](https://jaredwhite.com/20220425/back-to-the-open-web)

> Back to the #openweb I go. Not that I ever left it‚Ä¶but to be quite frank, it‚Äôs so easy to post and get immediate feeback on Twitter that I spend most of my day-to-day ‚Äúchit-chat energy‚Äù there and not on my own website.
> 
> No longer! Now that Elon Musk is buying Twitter and taking it private, I‚Äôm done putting serious effort into creating content for walled gardens. Everything, and I mean everything I publish from here on out will start on my own properties and then get syndicated elsewhere.

[In reporting at The Verge, Emma Roth and Russell Brandom pontificate](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23028323/elon-musk-twitter-offer-buyout-hostile-takeover-ownership) "it‚Äôs unclear what impact Musk will have on Twitter or where he‚Äôll start with changes."

**Oh boy.**

Now while I was extremely pessimistic about the buyout idea and in fact had written the previous day in my diary: "I will f\*\*\*ing delete my Twitter account if Elon Musk buys Twitter" ‚Äî I nevertheless spent the rest of summer 2022 ready to be impressed. Maybe, _just maybe_, Elon would be touched by the better angels of his nature, and find a path forward for Twitter that‚Äîif not **excellent**, at least would not be **terrible**.

ü§°

I'll save my "two years later" rundown for additional reporting over at The Internet Review, but even my worst fears were _quaint_ by comparison to what actually transpired after Elon took over. As I wrote in [The Elon-gate'd Man](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/elongate) in November 2022:

> Remember all the people who‚Äîprior to the official takeover of Twitter‚Äîwere telling us that Elon Musk would moderate his behavior and behave more like a grown up because too much money and prestige were at stake? Remember all the people who said that because Elon (seemingly) had been unilaterally successful in bringing us fancy new space rockets and fancy new electric cars, he could now bring welcome insight and innovation into a rapidly-degenerating and fractious social media landscape?
> 
> Here‚Äôs the pertinent question: why do we keep believing this myth? As we‚Äôve seen over recent years and especially recent months, it‚Äôs being proven decisively, tragically wrong‚Ä¶over and over and over again.

and in my exhortation of what we should be focusing on instead:

> What I am saying is unequivocal: down with surveillance capitalism eroding our trust and access to free and fair online communications. We can do better. We must do better. And increasingly‚Äîthanks to Mastodon, ActivityPub, and other open source projects & protocols recently exploding in popularity‚Äîwe are.

It's worth noting that arguably the biggest impact being made on social media  right now is the competitive response to the downfall of Twitter in the form of Threads, Meta's broadcast-text-first social network. And the only reason Threads isn't uniformly horrifying as a product is because it's the first mass-market social network built with ActivityPub integration from the very start. (So that when #enshittification eventually comes, users and creators will have real options‚Ä¶ üòÖ)

**The #Fediverse‚Äîthe open social web‚Äîis growing exponentially**, with Threads leading the pact of commercial properties doing a one-eighty from clinging to an outdated "silo" mindset, and Mastodon and other volunteer projects holding their own in providing open source access to social media. _Progress!_ üëè

So while I still lament the death of Twitter, and the incalculable destruction of communities brought on by Elon Musk's _abysmal_ stranglehold over what is now X, I am also pleased to see how powerfully the momentum has shifted towards the Fediverse. **It's been the Worst of Times‚Ä¶and yet, the Best of Times.**
