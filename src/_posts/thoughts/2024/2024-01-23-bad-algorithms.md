It's hard to look back fondly on the Twitter algorithm in the days when it was still considered a "cool" platform to use. I routinely saw how links to blog posts would get _far_ less engagement than content Twitter deemed worthy of promotion like photos, topical tweets, etc. The whole "post a photo and also a link" instead of just having the link's graph image come through hack was just that, a hack. (Same issue on Facebook as well.) Perhaps in the early days of the platform this was much less so, butâ€¦well, #enshittification.

Blogging and social media algorithms ended up on a collision course last decade, and sadly blogs lost. Thankfully we now have the rare opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past. #OpenWeb #Fediverse #writing
