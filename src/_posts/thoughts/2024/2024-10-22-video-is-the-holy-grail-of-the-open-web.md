title: Video is the Holy Grail of the Open Web

The #openweb has conquered ~~all~~ some.

* You can post text and images directly on the web. It's very simple to do—even for non-geeks who just use Wix or Squarespace. Blogging is still very much a thing, and now with the rise of decentralized social media, we can claim that too. Even RSS is making a comeback!
* You can post audio directly on the web and create your own podcast. There are many hosts around which make this straightforward, and everyone is happy to use their "podcast player of choice".
* You can launch communities, accept payments, offer games, provide software, and all sorts of other digital goodies through a variety of tools and services on the open web.

But here's the thing which _nobody_ (\*) does directly on the web: **video**. Video was eaten by **YouTube**.

_YouTube has conquered all._ Yes for short form, also TikTok and Instagram. For streaming, also Twitch. But I'm primarily highlighting longer, typically pre-recorded, 16:9 videos. That market is _owned_ by YouTube, no question about it.

And that's extremely odd when you think about it. What other online medium is _so completely dominated_ by a single platform? It's so all-encompassing that people will literally describe their profession by the platform's name: _I am a YouTuber_. Nobody says "I'm a Facebooker" or "I'm a Twitcher" or "I'm a Spotifier". But they will gladly promote the fact they are a _YouTuber_. And even though people's "blog posts" are indeed part of the open web proper, people's #vlog episodes are virtually always found at a single destination. **Gee that sucks!**

I have come to the conclusion that YouTube poses an existential threat to the open web and to our broader society far and away more than any other corporate silo. And it's not just me—creators on YouTube themselves are increasingly upset with the #enshittification of the platform and the awful moderation policies which seem to punish "wokeness" while rewarding truly bad actors who spew misinformation and hatred.

Does anyone sincerely believe YouTube is getting…better? Or has it been steadily decaying for years? (Yes.) Speaking for myself personally, I find having to engage with YouTube in any way borderline oppressive. I already use it at little as possible directly, and prefer to subscribe to channels through [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). But trying to use a third-party frontend like Invidious is nearly impossible now, and even embedded video playback through Feedbin has gotten spotty. And even having switched off YouTube history entirely so I don't get that _horrible_ algorithmic front page, I'm still forced to look at a "related videos" sidebar which almost always has one or two videos which are clearly alt-right ragebait or general nonsense peddled by "influencers". It makes me sick, and I mean that quite literally.

**We need to do something about this.** And by we, I'm starting with me. I'm going to do something about it. I don't have anything to announce at this time, but I can tell you honestly: when I contemplate the future of the open web, there's _nothing_ that's lighting a fire under me more than how to solve the video problem and wean ourselves off of complete dominance by YouTube. We can't ignore this any longer. If you're a fan of RSS, if you're a fan of ActivityPub, if you're a fan of blogging and of podcasting, you absolutely can't ignore the elephant in the room.

_Video killed the open web star?_ Not if I can help it!

\* We're starting to see—and I've talked about this before—the rise of creator-friendly indie video subscription platforms. My favorite one is [Nebula](https://nebula.tv), and I watch a lot of shows on there. But it's still a drop in the bucket. We need 10000% more of that.
