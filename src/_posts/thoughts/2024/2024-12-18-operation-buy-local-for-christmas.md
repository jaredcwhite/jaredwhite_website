"Operation Buy Local" is a rousing success so far!

A few days ago I talked about [how I was going radical on this](/20241215/radically-local), and then today nearly by accident I wandered into a warehouse down by the river and discovered that it was [tens of thousands of square feet of vintage goods](https://www.memorydenpdx.com) along with wares by local #Portland artisans. I had a chance to talk with the Creative Director there and told him it was like Ikea if Ikea was a local antique mall!

**I absolutely had a blast and can't wait to go back.** I needed some stocking stuffers for the kids, so I ended up buying a toy, a necklace, and a couple of original art prints.

They even have a library! _A library!_

The creative director's own personal curated collection is quite something:
