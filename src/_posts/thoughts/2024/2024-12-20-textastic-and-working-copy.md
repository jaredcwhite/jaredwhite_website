I'm testing out a new blogging setup on my iPhone using [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/) and [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/). And I'm dictating this post using Siri, so in a sense nothing I'm doing right now has anything to do with my #writing workflow on my iPad or Mac.

I contemplate how the type of post I would dictate, rather than type out, would be different. Perhaps this is me at my most raw, most unfiltered‚Ä¶**from my brain to your eyes**.

_Actually, I'm not sure who wants that‚Ä¶_ üòÇ

Here's a cool thing. In Textastic **I can create my own file templates**. I've created one for the [Thoughts](https://jaredwhite.com/browse/thoughts) category, which this post is in, and I can create other templates for categories like [Links](https://jaredwhite.com/browse/links) or [Essays](https://jaredwhite.com/browse/articles). Because Markdown is plain text, working with it even on a small screen is quite straightforward.

Finish the post, push it up to my repo using Working Copy, wait for #Bridgetown to rebuild my site‚Ä¶and we're done.

**Oh I'm digging this.** ‚ò∫Ô∏è
