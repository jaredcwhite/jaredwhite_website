Going through an emotional rough patch earlier this week, and then (in an unconnected happenstance) watching _Gran Turismo_ (I'd missed seeing the movie when it first came out in theaters), it started to dawn on me how much I've begun to value my "offline identity" relative to my "online identity". Online, I talk about all the things I pontificate about on social media, blogs, podcasts, etc., and I write lots of code. Offline, I walk/cycle/scoot (#micromobility has become very important to me!), meet new people, enjoy live music, and engage in a variety of activities with my #family in and around #Portland.

Somehow, the "juice" I get out of life is trending in that direction: **IRL**. The reason _Gran Turismo_ got me musing on this is because prior to this year, I'd _never_ thought of myself as an "athlete"â€¦_never_ thought of myself as a "fitness buff".

**I think that's changing.** And for this once-chubby nerd, it's _super weird!_ ðŸ˜… But super fun.
