title: Merry Christmas (in an Irish Castle)!
---

I wish you and yours all the best this holiday season. 😊🎄🎁

And for a little treat: a **blast from the past**! In another life (2001), I performed Celtic music playing the recorder, Irish whistle, and other wind instruments, and our band **Distant Oaks** was privileged to join a host of other musicians and singers to record _Christmas in an Irish Castle_, produced by [Revels](https://revels.org).

Here is our rendition of _I Saw Three Ships_:

Alas, it doesn't seem like the album is available for online streaming anymore, but you may be able to find a CD used on eBay, Amazon, etc.

As an alternative play, I can highly recommend my friend and extraordinarily-talented Irish harper Patrick Ball's album [The Christmas Rose](https://music.apple.com/us/album/celtic-harp-the-christmas-rose/201155377). It'll get you right in the spirit of Christmas for sure.
