My relationship with my city changed when I came to #Portland. Before that, I always had the general impression that I lived in my "house" and that house merely happened to be located in a city/town/countryside/etc. But upon moving to Portland, Oregon and really embracing an urban lifestyle, my perspective changed. Now I _live in Portland_. My house is nothing more than the residence I am physically placed in at various times for sleep, recreation, and remote work. But I also regularly engage in both work and recreation elsewhere in the city, and those places mean every bit as much to me as anywhere I might lay my head at night.

I suppose that may sound quite strange to someone who is very emotionally and nostalgically attached to their literal dwelling. Maybe it's a personality thing… All I can tell you—as someone who is currently a renter—I have owned my own home in the past and…I ended up hating it. Resenting it.

My allegiance is to a city…MY city…not any particular residential unit within it.
