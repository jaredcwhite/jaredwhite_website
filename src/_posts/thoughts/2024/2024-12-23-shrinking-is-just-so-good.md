_Shrinking_ is simply one of the best #TVShows on air.

Honestly better than it has any right to be (even though yes, that's one stacked cast!). Now I realize my emotions are a bit raw at the moment, having come down with a bug (gee, thanks kids!) for the _third_ time in a row before ever getting completely well again. It's been a fun 6 weeks, that's for sure! ðŸ™„

But even so, watching the finale of _Shrinking_ Season 2 on Apple TV+ tonight, **I was bawling**. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Bawling I tell you! I think if someone else had been in the room with me, they would have thought something had gone terribly terribly wrong.

I will admit, I did originally think Season 2 was starting off a bit on the slow side. I was wondering if they'd reach the heights of the **stellar** first season. Well at this point there's no doubt in my mind. Every episode over the recent stretch has been "Oh, you think _that_ was _all_ the feelz? **You ain't felt nuttin' yet!**"

Make sure you have ample tissues handy when you watch this show. **Bawling**, I tell you.
