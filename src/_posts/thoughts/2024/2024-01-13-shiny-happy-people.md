A little late to the party, but I finally watched [Shiny Happy People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_Happy_People:_Duggar_Family_Secrets), the documentary series about the Duggar family and the fundamentalist Christian religious world they inhabit.

I have So Many Thoughts, as [someone very familiar with this world](https://simplepraxis.life/2019/leaving-it-all-behind-my-exvangelical-story) circa 2004-2016. I hope to share my in-depth perspective soon, but for now I'll just say this:

We need a LOT more "exvangelical" documentaries. We need more people telling their story. We need these stories represented in art, literature, and cinema. Given the #spirituality dimension we see in American #politics today, it has never been more important.￼

(Parting thought: we need to hold media accountable for promoting fundamentalism or at least giving it a pass. The Duggars should _never_ have been given a national mainstream TV platform. TLC/Discovery should be ashamed of themselves.￼)￼
