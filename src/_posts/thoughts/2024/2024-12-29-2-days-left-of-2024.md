title: 2 Days 2 Dreary
---

As I write this, we're just two days, two hours, and change away from **January 1, 2025**. ðŸ«¨

I think a lot of people have a complicated relationship with the passing of time in this manner. While it can be comforting to feel a sense of closure, the end of a chapter in a person's life and the fresh beginning of a new one, there is also serious trepidation over the future. And given the _unprecedented lolololz_ events of the last few years, there's no doubt that a great many of us are fighting off despair and depression as we contemplate how this next year might unfold.

**I'd be lying if I said I personally am "excited" about 2025.** That's just not a word I can trot out in all good conscience. But one thing I _can_ tell you is I feel as grounded in the core of my being as I ever have, and I'm as committed to the values I hold dear as I ever have been. I know what I stand for, I know what I'll fight for, and I know who is with me. **I'm not in the least bit conflicted.**

And that, truth be told, is a pretty fucking great feeling.

Happy New Year & _Â¡Viva la RevolucÃ­on!_
