All right, this took me _way_ too long to fix, but I've taken a page right out of Dave Winer's playbook ([recent nudges here](http://scripting.com/2022/12/16.html)) and changed my [feed output](/feed.xml) so "titleless" posts (like this one) are truly titleless. Any feed reader these days worth its salt should work with that just fine. Now I just need to get in the habit of microblogging more often _here_, rather than on Mastodon!
