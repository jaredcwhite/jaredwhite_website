Back to the #openweb I go. Not that I ever left itâ€¦but to be quite frank, it's _so_ easy to post and get immediate feedback on #Twitter that I spend most of my day-to-day "chit-chat energy" there and _not_ on my own #website.

[No longer!](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23028323/elon-musk-twitter-offer-buyout-hostile-takeover-ownership) Now that Elon Musk is buying Twitter and taking it private, I'm _done_ putting serious effort into creating content for walled gardens. Everything, and I mean _everything_ I publish from here on out will **start on my own properties** and then get syndicated elsewhere.

I'm also in the process of switching from Revue (owned by Twitter) to [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com) for my email newsletter. In the meantime, feel free to [email me](mailto:jared@jaredwhite.com) to get in touch! ðŸ˜ƒ
