â€¦nobody knows. ðŸ˜„

I literally searched DuckDuckGo for ["what is the perfect blog post length?"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+the+perfect+blog+post+length%3F) and got a wide variety of different answers all on the first page. I suppose it entirely depends on the genre, the author, and the audience. In other words, perfection will be forever illusory.

So I took a look at what I'd written so far throughout the year, and for short ["thought" posts](/browse/thoughts/) like this, the average seems to be around 300 words. For longer [article-style posts](/browse/articles/), the average seems to be around 900.

Rather than leave it random chance, I'm going to try an experiment to see if I can keep the length of short posts a little bit shorterâ€”say around 200 wordsâ€”so that I'm more motivated to write and publish them, and conversely strive to ensure essays clock in at no less than 1000 words.

This is all part of my [renewed push](/now/2022-09-12) to design a more disciplined and appealing workflow for blogging. You'd think I would have figured this stuff out by now! ðŸ˜‚ (Always more to learnâ€¦)
