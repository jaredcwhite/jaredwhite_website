I regret a lot of things.

I regret spending so much time contributing content to corporate social media. I regret expending my limited creative and financial resources all in the service of Big Tech.

But you know what I don't regret?

**Publishing content on my own #website.** Yes, right here. And in other places I inhabit on the internet. And even on sites that no longer exist, because _thank you_ [Wayback Machine](/articles/thank-goodness-for-the-wayback-machine).

It makes me think that, huh, perhaps I should spending more time publishing content in places I "own". Even if my website is technically hosted on a service I don't control, the content 100% belongs to me, and I can take it with me anywhere I want because [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).

Maybe the #openweb would be in better shape if more people valued personal domain names as much as they value other things in life. I'm coming to realize [jaredwhite.com](https://jaredwhite.com) is one of the most prized possessions in life.
