<blockquote>
<p class="">God never leads husbands and wives in different directions, because He desires unity and oneness in marriage. The Holy Spirit will never prompt a wife in one direction and the husband in another, and this unity is a very useful check in determinining the leading of the Holy Spirit for our lives.</p>
