<blockquote>
<p class="">The Iroquois had a rule about making decisions for the seventh generation. We’re not even making decisions for <i>this</i>&nbsp;generation. We’re making decisions for <i>me.</i>…it seems obvious that business needs to take into account a bigger view of cause and effect, of interdependence.</p>
