<blockquote>
  <p class="">When I sit down to write a book, I do not say to myself, ‘I am going to produce a work of art.’ I write it because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class=""><em>George Orwell</em></p>
