My 36th birthday is coming up this month, and something I've been wanting to do for years is promote a fundraising campaign for charity: water. [So that's exactly what I'm doing!](https://my.charitywater.org/jaredcwhite/make-my-36th-a-special-one) Your donation will directly help bring clean drinking water to communities around the world. 🙏🏻💜
