I used to blog a ton about #freelancing and maximizing your productivity and success as a "free agent" — I even tried running a local meetup here in the #Portland area.

It just occurred to me I hadn't done much of that in a long while. I do still talk about #creativity and time management on occasion in my Creator Class newsletter and in the podcast, but not specifically about working as a freelancer.

As I look ahead to some of the product-driven work I'm participating in this year, I think it may be a good time to start this up again. Juggling client projects and product efforts (including open source software) is always this intricate dance of managing energy levels and expectations (and income!). Takes a lot of practice. I'm not saying I've reached "expert level" or anything…but it's a nice feeling to know I'm performing much better now than in years prior.
