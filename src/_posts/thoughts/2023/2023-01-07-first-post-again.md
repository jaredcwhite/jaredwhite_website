Fun fact: this is the first post I've made in quite some time using a CMS (Content Management System).

_But wait!_ you say. _Your #website is built with Bridgetown. Are you saying Bridgetown now has its own CMS?_

Well, I could tell you, **but then I'm afraid I'd have to kill you**. ðŸ˜Ž

A brief bit of context here: I've built a number of CMSes over the many years I've been a web developerâ€”several just in the era of Jekyll. Because of that prior experience, I have _deeply resisted_ building a CMS for [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) because I know how incredibly "easy" it seems at first and how incredibly hard it actually is in practice.

But I think I may have finally cracked this nut, and it has less to do with building a CMS per se and more to do with building a platform and a toolkit which lets developers build themselves a CMS. That's all I can say for now. **Stay tuned**. ðŸ˜„
