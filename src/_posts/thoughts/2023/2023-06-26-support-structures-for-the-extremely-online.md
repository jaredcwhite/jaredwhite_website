title: Support Structures for the Extremely Online
tags: lifehacks
---

I am what some folks might call [Extremely Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_online). I've certainly wrestled with this at times, and there have been moments when I feel the need to pull back from incessantly scrolling through whatever timeline is in vogue (for me these days that's Mastodon) and commenting with meme GIFs.

But I've come to accept my fate. Furthermore, **this is something I'm good at**. Yes that right, I'm good at internetting (for better or worse). What I'm _not_ so good at is occasionally dipping my toe into the water of being **Extremely Offline**.

Intentionally going offline is *vital* to my mental health (and yours too). For some people that might not prove such a huge issue as they have family ties or other social commitments IRL to attend to. For me though—except for the times I'm actively involved in playing with/supervising/teaching/going on adventures with my kids—I'm basically a single (divorced) dude who remote works, [quit attending church years ago](https://simplepraxis.life/2019/leaving-it-all-behind-my-exvangelical-story), and whose extended family all live out-of-state.

If I'm going to have a social life apart from opening up yet another chat window, I need to **wrangle my own support structure out of thin air**.

And so that's exactly what I've been doing this spring and summer. I've had to push myself—*force* myself some days—to get out there and Meet Real People. It doesn't always come naturally to me, but I'm _always_ glad when I do it.

Shout out to [Meetup](https://meetup.com) which—despite a rocky road these past few years first being acquired by WeWork and then being let go among all the zaniness there—still seems to be going strong and providing **an excellent way of discovering groups of people IRL doing interesting things**.

I've gone on hikes, focused on writing alongside fellow artists and creatives, laughed it up playing a wacky party game at a dinner event, and, yes, hung out with some local techies too. I've also been keeping an eye out for festivals or other fun community activities I might participate in. What will I be up to next? Who knows!

Having the sense of a local support structure apart from pixels on a screen, being able to look fellow humans in the eye and make a genuine emotional and intellectual connection, is something **I simply don't take for granted**. Having lived through a pandemic and been Extremely-Extremely Online for weeks or even months at a time (most of 2020 is simply a blur to me, I can't remember WTF I was even doing), a couple of hours of levity over a beer or walking along a forest path pointing out a grand vista or a word of encouragement from another creator in the room…**these are moments I treasure**. And I can't wait for more.

If you feel like you need more of a support structure where you live, **what's that single first step you might be able to take today?**
