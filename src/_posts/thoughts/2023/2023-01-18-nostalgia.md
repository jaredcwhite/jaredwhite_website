I've been thinking a lot about nostalgia lately. As an artist, to a certain extent you don't want to lean on nostalgia. It feels lazy. You should always be pushing the envelope, trying to be edgy and provocative. Original in some sense.

But nostalgia can be a worthy muse if you let it. The moment you cross over from old & tired to retro & vibrant isn't always easy to pin down, but it's absolutely real. And to master the subtle art of the throwback, the revival, the clever pasticheâ€¦well, there's nothing lazy about that.
