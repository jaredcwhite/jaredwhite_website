At last, the video you most definitely weren't waiting for, but got anyway! I'm rebooting my channel with a new name and a new focus, and I'm committing to releasing new videos every week. They won't all be as "produced" as this one, but hopefully they'll be fun and exciting and inspirational enough to be worthy of your interest. So please like, subscribe, yada yada, and let me know what you think!

> ### Season 2, Episode 1
> 
> Essential Life with Jared is a vlog series all about Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and the philosophy of essentialism. It's about finding your own way and never walking somebody else's path. It's about living a life that's most meaningful to you.
