One minute, I was strolling through the quaint neighborhoods and gentle parks of west Hillsboro…mere miles away from Portland, OR. Next thing you know, I'm totally LOST in the the woods! Do I ever make it out alive??? You'll just have to watch this video to find out.

Also another essentialism challenge to help you streamline your life and lose the "guilt factor" when considering which objects to keep and which to discard. Let me know how it goes OK?

> Essential Life with Jared is a vlog series all about Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and the philosophy of essentialism. It's about finding your own way and never walking somebody else's path. It's about living a life that's most meaningful to you.
