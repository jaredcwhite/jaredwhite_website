This week's challenge is to practice the power of observation! Learn all about a fantastic awareness training technique I learned from Mindsight by Dr. Daniel Siegel.  And of course more Portland awesomeness, more trains, and more coffee! (Yes, Portland has some of the best coffee around. It's sort of our thing.)
