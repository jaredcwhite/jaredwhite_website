Do you ever feel like a failure? Ever worry you're not measuring up, that "they" are always more successful than you are? Maybe the issue isn't that you're actually a failure, but you're struggling with the *emotions* of failure, and that is something we can work with!

Watch the video for this week's essentialism challenge and let me how it's going for you!

> ### Season 2, Episode 4

> Essential Life with Jared is a vlog series all about Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and the philosophy of essentialism. It's about finding your own way and never walking somebody else's path. It's about living a life that's most meaningful to you.
