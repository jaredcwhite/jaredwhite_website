We're all told we need to say No to the things in life that aren't all that important or meaningful to us in order to say Yes to that which truly matters. But what if you HAVE NO CLUE what is most meaningful to you? What if you are in the middle of a creative slump, an "existential crisis," or just a transition to a new season of life? Maybe there's room to give yourself permission to say Yes to that slump, that crisis. Make space for your indecisiveness. Try a little bit of this, a little bit of that. See what sticks. See what *resonates.* I'm going through this process right now!
