Top vloggers who have reached the pinnacles of their career tell us not to obsess over views and relative performance over time and other metrics of "success" in their creative field. But that got me thinking: what SHOULD we obsess over? How do we know we're crushing it as content creators? What should success look like?

Here are my four measures of successâ€”they're by no means the only ones possible, but I believe they'll serve you well no matter what you're making as a content creator.

1. Have Fun
2. Grow in Your Craft
3. Be the Content Creator You Wish to See in the World
4. Streamline Your Pipeline

If you're pushing hard on all four points, good for you! You're well on your way to becoming a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious creator. =)
