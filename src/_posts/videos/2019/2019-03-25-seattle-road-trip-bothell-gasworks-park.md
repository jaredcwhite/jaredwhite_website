title: Seattle Road Trip // Bothell + Gasworks Park
description: I did something totally stupid…I accidentally erased my iMac hard drive which had a full edit of this video. Luckily I recovered the raw footage, so this is my SECOND attempt at putting a vlog episode together. I visited Bothell, WA — the place my mom wrote a piece of Celtic music for entitled “The Woods of Bothell” — as well as the way cool Gasworks Park in Seattle.

Luckily I recovered the raw footage, so this is my SECOND attempt at putting a vlog episode together. I visited Bothell, WA — the place my mom wrote a piece of Celtic music for entitled “The Woods of Bothell” — as well as the way cool Gasworks Park in Seattle.
