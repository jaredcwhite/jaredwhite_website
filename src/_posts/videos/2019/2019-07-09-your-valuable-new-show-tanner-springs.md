Announcing a brand new show in the works called Your Valuable! No, that's not incorrect grammer. It stands for:

* Your Valuable Apps
* Your Valuable Art
* Your Valuable Content
* Your Valuable Connections
* Your Valuable Data
* Your Valuable Devices

It's a show about how to take back control from Big Tech companies who monetize your valuable stuff for their own nefarious purposes. Learn via hands-on reviews, demonstrations, tips & techniques all about the products that can REALLY help you on a daily basis make amazing artistic creations and upgrade your life to be more fun, free, and rewarding!

(Also in the video…a walkabout near Tanner Springs and other Pearl District locations in Portland, Oregon.)

> ### Season 3, Episode 1
> 
> Essential Life with Jared is a vlog series all about Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and the philosophy of essentialism. It's about finding your own way and never walking somebody else's path. It's about living a life that's most meaningful to you.
