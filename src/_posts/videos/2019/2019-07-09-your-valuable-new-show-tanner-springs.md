Announcing a brand new show in the works called Your Valuable! No, that's not incorrect grammer. It stands for:

* Your Valuable Apps
* Your Valuable Art
* Your Valuable Content
* Your Valuable Connections
* Your Valuable Data
* Your Valuable Devices

It's a show about how to take back control from Big Tech companies who monetize your valuable stuff for their own nefarious purposes. Learn via hands-on reviews, demonstrations, tips & techniques all about the products that can REALLY help you on a daily basis make amazing artistic creations and upgrade your life to be more fun, free, and rewarding!

(Also in the videoâ€¦a walkabout near Tanner Springs and other Pearl District locations in Portland, Oregon.)

> ### Season 3, Episode 1
> 
> Essential Life with Jared is a vlog series all about Portland, the Pacific Northwest, and the philosophy of essentialism. It's about finding your own way and never walking somebody else's path. It's about living a life that's most meaningful to you.
