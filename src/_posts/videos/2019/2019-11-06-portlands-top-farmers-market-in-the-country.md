title: Portland's Top Farmers Market in the Country
description: Well OK, it's one of the top "pop up" markets (meaning everyone completely
  sets up and tears down everything in a day) in the United States which is open year-round.
  I think that's pretty awesome. Plus lots of great scenes of traversing downtown
  Portland in the fall!
