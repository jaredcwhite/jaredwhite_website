title: Midsummer Adventures at Mt. Hood
description: 'You can rarely go wrong visiting the tallest mountain in Oregon and
  a true jewel of the Cascades: Mt. Hood. This time, I visited in August 2023, taking
  the ski lifts up the slope from Timberline Lodge and then hiking back down while
  enjoying the epic views. Then I dropped by Trillium Lake for the first time. Wow!
  This location was definitely worth the hype. Gotta go backâ€¦'
