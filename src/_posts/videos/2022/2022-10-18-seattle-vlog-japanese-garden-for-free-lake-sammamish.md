You know that giant lake near Seattle? No, I'm not talking about Lake Washington. I'm talking about Lake Sammamish! Yeah, that other one further to the right on the map. Turns out it's pretty awesome!  
  
You know what else is awesome? A beautiful Japanese Garden with bridges and koi ponds and bells and waterfallsâ€¦all for the low, low admission price of: FREE. That's right. Zero. Zip. Nada. Kubota Garden is a MUST STOP on any Seattle trip.  
  
We also took the ferry over to Vashon Island. Gotta admit: there's not much to do there for tourists. But the beach was pretty.  
  
Finally, I made it back to Portlandâ€”on a train this time! Nice.
