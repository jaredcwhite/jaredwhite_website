title: I tried to take the trainâ€¦thrown on a bus?! // Epic PNW Views
  Anyway!
description: I thought I was taking an Amtrak train from Portland to Seattle, like
  I had done before. I was wrongâ€¦the train was delayed and they threw me on a bus
  instead! Not coolâ€¦BUT it did still get me to Seattle in a reasonable timeframe.
  From there I headed off to work at WeWork, visit the Seattle Waterfront, and meet
  up with my bro. Next day Shayne and I got to see some stunning views of Snoqualmie
  Falls, as well as visit a beautiful country lake in the town of Kent, WA.
