Welcome back to my YouTube channel! Kickstarting the next vlog series…a casual record of my life in Portland, Oregon on a regular basis and finding a path forward after a very difficult last two years.

In the back half of the episode, [I explore the Molalla River Recreation Area!](https://www.blm.gov/visit/molalla)

And be sure to [check out my review of Nope (2022)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPpjGriJpvk), an atmospheric tour de force by the ever talented Jordan Peele! 

> ### Season 6, Episode 1
> 
> Essential Life with Jared is a vlog series all about adventure in Portland & the Pacific Northwest…and discovering wonder and meaning in the every day. It's about finding your own way and never walking somebody else's path. It's about living a creative life which expresses what's uniquely you.
