After months of staying at home and sheltering during the pandemic, I just couldn't take it any more. I had to get out of the city and see fresh scenery and recharge. Making sure to remain socially distanced and take every precaution while traveling, I was able to drive along the gorgeous Oregon coastline and enjoy some much needed R&R. This is a mini-documentary about my journey!
