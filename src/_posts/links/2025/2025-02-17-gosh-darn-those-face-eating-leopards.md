  “When we said safer borders, I thought he was thinking ‘let’s stop the drugs from coming into the country,’” Trump voter Staci White said. “I didn’t know he was going to start raiding places. Now I’m like: ‘Dang, why didn’t I just pick Kamala?’”

🎶 **I never thought the leopards would eat my face!** 🎶

Look, it's easy (and more than a little cathartic) to make fun of these people who voted for Trump—not talking about in 2016 or even 2020 _but in 2024 for Pete's sake!_—and then are simply flabbergasted and dumbfounded that **Trump has gleefully gone to war with his own people for personal gain and unchecked power**.

But I also think it's worth noting that we are in the midst of **an all-out information war**. In the link directly above, the farmer claims he was told Project 2025 wasn't actually Trump's platform. And in the quoted article, the woman says she didn't know Trump planed on conducting raids.

Guess what? **I believe them!** And while I won't lose any sleep over them being ridiculed online for their horrible taste in #politics, I do think _we should be putting the vast majority of our efforts_ into combatting this scourge of misinformation and disinformation that caused Kamala Harris to lose the 2024 election. Yes, that is my contention: her loss was _almost entirely due_ to **hundreds of millions of Americans being repeatedly and outrageously lied to**. I'm not implying I think the Trumpy MAGA base is misinformed (they're truly the bad guys), but I'm saying the people who are considered "moderate" or not super engaged in politics at all got fed a steaming pile of horseshit.

If the Democratic Party and progressive activists/journalists/policy-makers can't get a real and lasting handle on this war before the next national election, I fear it may be too late to turn this ship around. **The window of positive change is narrowing rapidly.** And the time to act was yesterday.
