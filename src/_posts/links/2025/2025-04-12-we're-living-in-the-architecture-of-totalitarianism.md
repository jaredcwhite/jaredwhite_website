  There is an alignment of interests that runs through Silicon Valley to what is now a coming autocracy. It's a type of power that the world has never seen before.

  And forget the killer robots. If you want to know what the first great AI apocalypse is, we're already living it. It's total information collapse. And if you take one thing only away from this talk, it's politics is technology now.

🚨 **This TED talk is an absolute must-watch.** 🚨

We're witnessing a digital coup unfolding in real-time, according to British journalist Carole Cadwalladr—one of the original reporters who covered the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer Prize. The _broligarchy_ is reshaping world order as we speak, and while we may feel powerless to stop it, all hope is not lost if we start to act NOW. We need to name the exact problems and be completely unshamed to hold all in both #politics and Big Tech who are perpetrating these atrocities accountable.

I want to [copy here verbatim from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Cadwalladr) just how many awards Carole Cadwalladr has to her name. She is a force to be reckoned with, _and a voice who must be heard_.

* British Journalism Awards' Technology Journalism Award in December 2017
* Specialist Journalist of the Year 2017 at the National Society of Editors Press Awards
* Orwell Prize for Political Journalism in June 2018 (for her work "on the impact of big data on the EU Referendum and the 2016 US presidential election").
* Reporters without Borders "L'esprit de RSF" award in November 2018 (for her work on subversion of democratic processes).
* The 2018 Polk Award for National Reporting with reporters from the New York Times.
* The 2018 Stieg Larsson Prize, an annual award of 200,000 krona for people working in Stieg Larsson's spirit.
* Political Studies Association Journalist of the Year in November 2018 (joint award with Amelia Gentleman) for her persistence and resilience in pursuing "investigative journalism on subjects such as personal data".
* Two 2018 British Journalism Awards for Technology Reporting and Investigation.
* Technology Journalist of the Year in the 2018 Society of Editors awards.
* The 2019 Gerald Loeb Award for Investigative Reporting.
* The annual Hay Festival's Medal for Journalism in May 2019, "for the heroic and rigorous investigative journalism".
* Finalist, 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, alongside The New York Times reporters, for her coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
* Winner, 2023 Quaker Truth & Integrity Award.

So yeah. I think maybe her dire warning of just how much trouble our world is in right now bears **serious** consideration.

One more pull-quote from the talk because I was jumping out of my seat and shouting when she said this. THIS, THIS, THIS is what we need right now. THIS is what the moment requires. 100% commitment to the resistance! 🙌

> So I want to leave you with this. This is ChatGPT writing a TED Talk in the style of Carole Cadwalladr. And it is creepily plausible. But what it doesn't know, because AI is actually as dumb as a rock, is that I am going to turn to Sam Altman, who is coming here, a TED speaker, and say that this does not belong to you. ChatGPT has been trained on my IP, my labor, my personal data. And I did not consent.

👏 **YES!!!!** 👏
