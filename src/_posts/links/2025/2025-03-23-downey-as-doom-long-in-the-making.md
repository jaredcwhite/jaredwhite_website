  When Downey walked onstage dressed as Doctor Doom at San Diego Comic-Con last year it was a shocker to nearly everyone, in large part because he had already saved the Marvel Universe as Tony Stark. But it seems the concept of Downey as bad guy Victor Von Doom goes way back to before the actor was ever cast as Iron Man’s alter ego.

There are a whole lot of chattering commenters out there all butthurt that Downey is coming back to the MCU. It cheapens Iron Man's death, it's just to sell more tickets, Marvel's out of ideas, the Russo Brothers can't make a good non-Marvel film what's up with that, _blah blah blah blah blah blah blah_.

Get outta here! **Robert Downey Jr. can do no wrong.** I am completely onboard with his reappearance as one of Marvel's classic villains. We already know he can deliver a pitch-perfect performance which straddles the fence between hamming it up for the camera and _absolutely nailing_ complex emotional depth. People will throw out this name and that name for who _should_ be playing Victor Von Doom, but you know what? We already have a "Marvel Jesus" and no offense to Deadpool but it ain't him. **It's Iron Man.** (Or rather, the actor who portrayed him.)

**Bring it on!**
