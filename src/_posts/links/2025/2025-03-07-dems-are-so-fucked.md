  House Democratic leadership is privately confronting members who disrupted President Trump's speech to Congress, Axios has learned.

  **Why it matters:** Many progressives defied House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' (D-N.Y.) request to avoid making themselves the story.

Serious question, has Hakeem Jeffries actually DONE _anything_ useful lately? The guy seems like an empty suit to me. I find myself nodding off anytime he's being asked questions in an interview.

Can we pleeeeuuzze just put AOC & Jasmine Crockett in charge of this party?! They're the *only people*\* who have _any_ star power whatsoever at this point. Everyone else is a **snoozefest**, and Trump goes through right through them like tinfoil. #politics

\* Or Pete Buttigieg, but he doesn't hold any elected office at the moment. That fella is _outrageously talented._
