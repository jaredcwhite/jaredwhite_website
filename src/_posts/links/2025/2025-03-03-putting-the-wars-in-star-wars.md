The first season of _Star Wars: Andor_ was a revelation. And that's only become more true in the years (!!) since its debut because let's face it, Disney+ Star Wars TV has mostly been a shitshow. I can hardly name _any_ episodes of any of those shows I'd want to subject myself to a second time. (I did enjoy _Skeleton Crew_ quite a bit, as well as some of _The Mandalorian_—and I might have at least enjoyed the "promise" of _The Acolyte_ had it not been unceremoniously canceled!)

_Andor_ is **clearly** the standout example of the bunch, and it's not even close. I personally consider this show one of the best #scifi #tvshows of all time—and the fact that it's set in the **Star Wars universe** is essentially a footnote. [As I wrote in 2022 when the first season concluded:](/links/20221211/andor-is-the-best-star-wars-since-the-last-jedi)

> With adult themes and expert world-building—along with an amazing and awe-inspiring takedown of fascist ideology which speaks poignantly to the present zeitgeist—this is a show that deserves to be taken seriously.

I am **eagerly anticipating*** the second and final season which purports to end exactly where _Rogue One_ begins. I must admit, I didn't find that movie all that compelling when I originally watched it, but perhaps with the context of _Andor_ applied, I'll get more out of it on a fresh watch.

I'm also quite ready to **once again enjoy watching rebel factions take down fascist dickwads**…times being what they are and all. 🫠
