  This is a video about YouTube thumbnails, and why they all look so dang similar these days. Itâ€™s easy to want to blame Mr. Beast, but is it really his fault? Or is he just a victim of a relentless algorithm that will do anything it can to suck as much of our precious watchtime out of us as humanly possible, ultimately forcing creators to game the system as best as they can in order to stay on topâ€¦ wait a minute... no itâ€™s definitely his fault.

I'm a massive fan of **Ryan George** (and so are my kids!)â€¦I legit think he's one of the funniest guys on YouTube. Recently he's branched out of pure comedy sketches and is doing more biting social commentary (that is still full of LOL moments!), and this is one of his best entries yet.

I truly loathe the YouTube thumbnail face (you know the face!) and all the annoying block yellow lettering. And I hate myself that I too have done the very same thing in the past, because it's just part of that culture y'know? ðŸ˜«
