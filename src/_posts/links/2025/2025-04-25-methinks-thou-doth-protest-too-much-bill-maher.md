  On Friday’s episode of *Real Time*, the comedian went on a tangent about taking “some shit from the ‘looney left’” over his dinner with Trump, referencing Larry David’s recent *New York Times* essay “My Dinner with Hitler” about the meeting.

I read Larry David's satire piece for the Times.￼ **It was very funny of course.** It should be noted  I am a huge, huge fan of Larry David. Bill Maher, not so much.

**The fact he really seems to have gotten his knickers in a twist over this exchange** ￼seems to me a sign his conscience is a bit discomfited…but OK, keep digging that hole for yourself.

And no, nobody is arguing you can't ever sit down for dinner with _anyone_ who is on the other side. Just, y'know, _Orange Hitler.￼_
