  The Segway Ninebot F3 is here with new and upgraded features, components, specs, and performance! In this video I'll unbox it and give you my first impressions of this 3rd generation commuter scooter.

Last month [I mentioned I've been eager to see which new Segway scooter might be a contender](/links/20250316/preliminary-look-at-segway-max-g3) for replacing my aging F30, and I was temporarily distracted by the first reviews of the MAX G3. But honestly, it's just too big, too heavy, and too expensive for what I'm in the market for.

The F3 is now getting its moment in the sun, and from what I'm seeing so far, it seems like a truly excellent ride for a remarkable price (potential tariff insanity notwithstanding).ï¿¼ I think it's _very_ likely this will be my new #micromobility vehicle come summertime. ðŸ˜Ž
