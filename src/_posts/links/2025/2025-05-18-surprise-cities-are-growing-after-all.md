  The population of Portland increased in 2024 for the first time since COVID-19 shut down the economy, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The increase is included in the Vintage 2024 Estimates for American cities and towns that was released on Thursday, May 15. The population increase follows growth in downtown foot traffic over the past few years reported by Downtown Portland Clean & Safe, the downtown service district that tracks downtown visits.

You wouldn't believe the rhetoric getting spewed right and left over how cities in "blue" states, particularly here on the U.S. west coast, were shedding population in favor of people moving out to the 'burbs and red state areas instead. It took a pandemic, they said, for people to realize they should escape these urban hellholes and move out to the _real America_ of the ["small town"](https://genius.com/Jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-lyrics).

Only thing is that isn't true. Or if it were at one point temporarily true, **it's not anymore.**

(Honestly, I think the urban/rural divide is simply more culture war nonsense. We'd all figure out how to get along and respect each other if it weren't for cynical politicians and far-right agitators turning it into yet another wedge issue…)
