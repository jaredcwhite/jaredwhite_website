  Fossil fuels just hit a record low in the US electricity mix last month, while solar and wind soared to all-time highs, according to fresh data from global energy think tank Ember.
  
  In March 2025, fossil fuels accounted for less than 50% â€“ 49.2% â€“ of electricity generated for the first month on record. This beats the previous monthly record low of 51% set in April 2024.

**Incredible news.** ðŸ™Œ

I've mentioned this in passing before, but I will reiterate it here in the strongest terms: advances in solar power generation combined with advances in battery technology is ushering in a unbelievable paradigm shift in how electricityï¿¼ gets produced (and by whom!).

If we're in "the Age of" anything right now after the rise of computers/the Internet, it's **the Age of Solar**. (And yes, wind and other renewable energy sources are a factor as well.)
