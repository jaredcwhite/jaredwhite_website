  But remember, I’m not actually committed to anything I say or do that provokes them into wokesplaining conniptions. I’m just asking questions. Or playing devil’s advocate. Or trolling for the lolz.

  Life would be much easier for the woke if they remembered that, at the end of the day, virtually no contentious pieces of legislation or civil rights issues ever affect me personally. Politics, government, and public policy are just games for me, and I play to win. So, when I throw out a whataboutism here and a “both sides” there, I’m just tossing curve balls to strike out the libs who get so mad they start yelling. When they quit the debate and block me online, I win.

Everything about this satirical essay by Dash MacIntyre is **genius**—and what makes it scarily good is _just how close it is_ to literal reality. Some days I still find it hard to believe that this is the state of #politics in America today, but the sad fact of the matter is that **trolls are routinely rewarded** in the digital media landscape we find ourselves in. Until that somehow changes, expect more of the same.
