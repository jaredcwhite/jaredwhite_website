  Studies show that e-bikes are effective in reducing the amount of miles driven in cars, since, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics, more than half of all trips in the United States are less than three miles — the ideal jaunt on an e-bike. But car owners often default to making car trips because the vehicle is right outside.

  But a different economic incentive could change that, said Ryan Birkicht, the communications director of People For Bikes.

This is neat idea: offering rebates to help subsidize #micromobility purchases in order to replace trips by car in specific regions/neighborhoods. (Obviously my preference would be to offer broad subsidies at high levels of city or state governments. But programs like this are certainly far better than nothing!￼)
