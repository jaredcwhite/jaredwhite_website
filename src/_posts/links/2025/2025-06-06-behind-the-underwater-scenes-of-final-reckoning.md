  “The big breakthrough on this movie was I got in the water,” said McQuarrie. “What happens normally when you’re directing an underwater sequence is you are above water, and you’re talking to an assistant director, who’s on a microphone, talking to everybody underwater, so you’re directing through mediaries.”

  Not only did the “M:I” team increase the number of underwater shoot days from ten on “Rogue” to 22 on “Final Reckoning,” but McQuarrie’s learning to scuba-dive so he could direct underwater meant going from six to 22 setups a day.

I can't say _Final Reckoning_ is my favorite of the _Mission: Impossible_ #movies, but I enjoyed it very much and the underwater submarine scenes not only loom large in my appreciate for this film, but stand out among all of the jaw-dropping set pieces of the franchise. Learning more about how the M:I wizards built and shot this never-been-done-before set only enhances the experience.
