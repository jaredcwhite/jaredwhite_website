_Zootopia_ is one of my favorite Disney #movies, no joke. It's right up there with the best of the best. I believe I actually enjoy it more than my kids do, who for inexplicable reasons find it only mildly amusing. I remember feeling absolutely blown away by it when I first saw it in my local cinema, and **I simply cannot wait** for a similar feeling when the sequel comes out. Fingers/toes/paws crossed! üêæ
