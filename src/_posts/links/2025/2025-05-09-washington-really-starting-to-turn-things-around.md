title: "Washington State Really Starting to Turn Things Around (re: Transit-Oriented Development)"
link_excerpt: |
  Senate Bill 5184, sponsored by Senator Jessica Bateman (D-22nd, Olympia), represents one of the most comprehensive parking reform bills enacted in any US state. In any city with more than 30,000 residents, builders will be prevented from being required to add more than one off-street parking space for every two units in an apartment building, nor more than two spaces for every 1,000 square feet of commercial space.

I love many places _in_ the State of Washington. **I do not particularly like Washington.**

It feels like the kind of place that _would_ be much farther ahead of the curve than, say, California when it comes to crowded, fast-growing dense urban areas weaning themselves off of car dependency. And yet whenever I try maneuvering my vehicle through Seattle and even smaller farther-flung towns, I feel like the traffic is absolutely off-the-charts insane. Most days I can drive through downtown Portland more easily than I can get through "sleepy" Washington urban areas which might not even be within Seattle city limits. _Frankly I refuse to drive in Seattle ever again. Period. I will take the train in instead._

All that to say, I am glad that Washington is really starting to turn things around. Bills like this—which aren't even about _forbidding_ housing developers to build lots of parking but rather _not legally mandating_ so much damn parking in the first place—are a most welcome improvement. Fewer car-owning city dwellers means even more pressure to build world-class transit, encourage #micromobility use, and design **pedestrianized central spaces**.

There's also—FINALLY—major new light rail lines opening up on the east side of Lake Washington, and [the big one connecting Seattle to Bellevue](https://www.soundtransit.org/system-expansion/east-link-extension) is slated to open early next year. I am losing my mind with anticipation of being able to flit back and forth between two of Washington's great urban centers on a train.

None of this is enough to make me want to leave Oregon, mind you, but it _definitely_ gives me more incentive to head on up and enjoy playing the tourist. Oh, and I did I mention [Pike Place Market is now closed to most automobile traffic](https://www.knkx.org/transportation/2025-05-08/seattle-pike-place-market-tests-car-ban-pilot-downtown-overlook-walk-flowers-vendors) as well? **Heck yeah!**

> “There’s some real beauty about all those interconnected pieces that just make for a really inspiring and pleasant journey,” Rachel Ligtenberg, executive director of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority, said. “It is vastly more walkable.”

_Finally._
