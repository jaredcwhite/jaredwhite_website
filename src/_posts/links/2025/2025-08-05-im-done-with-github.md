title: I’m Done with GitHub. Bye!
link_excerpt: |
  GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke:

  The evidence is clear: Either you embrace AI, or get out of this career.
  
  AI is on track to write 90% of code within the next 2–5 years.

  [Programming] students must now learn to guide AI, critique its work, and think across disciplines. Assessments should measure collaboration with AI, not isolation from it.

That's it. **I won't be starting any new software projects on GitHub going forward.** I'm done with the platform and to the extent that I am able, I am leaving GitHub.

The core team for [Bridgetown web framework](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) actually discussed migrating Bridgetown development away from GitHub earlier this year, but we decided to put that idea on hold since it's a ton of work. I expect it'll remain on hold for a while.

But any *new* projects? Oh yeah, I'm never touching GitHub again. Thomas Dohmke can go pound sand.

**I am very excited** with what the folks at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) have been doing, built on top of the open source [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) platform. Imagine that, an open source project powering the sharing of open source software. _We should have been doing that all along._

GitHub was a huge mistake, on par with trusting Twitter for all microblogging and news broadcasting. Now we're royally fucked, and it's going to take a _lot_ of work to untangle ourselves from this godawful mess.
