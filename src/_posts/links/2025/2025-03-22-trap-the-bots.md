  Cloudflare, one of the biggest network internet infrastructure companies in the world, has announced AI Labyrinth, a new tool to fight web-crawling bots that scrape sites for AI training data without permission. The company says in a blog post that when it detects “inappropriate bot behavior,” the free, opt-in tool lures crawlers down a path of links to AI-generated decoy pages that “slow down, confuse, and waste the resources” of those acting in bad faith.

We are truly in a next-generation digital arms race—having to defend ourselves against the spam and the slop of adversarial #generativeAI. I sure wish it were otherwise, but this is reminding me of the Windows virus epidemic of the 90s and the comment/trackback spam epidemic of the 2000s. **Ugh.**
