  I don't think it's hyperbole to say we as a country have never quite seen anything like this particularly appalling spectacle before.

I was on the road and very busy most of the day, so uncharacteristically I hadn't checked the news for a number of hours. I finally got ready to settle in for the evening, and my brother sent me this link of Chris Hayes talking about the Trump-Vance-Zelenskyy blowup/meltdown, so I watched it.

**Mr. Hayes, my good sir, it is not hyperbole in the least.** And it's hard for me to put into words how I'm even able to process what I witnessed.

I couldn't even watch it in one go. I had to pause several times to allow my brain to reconstitute its proper mental state in order to keep watching the scene, because _I was having meltdowns_ just trying to get through the recording.

It's inadequate to say I was shocked, horrified, aghast, and completely grossed out by this sorry, sorry display. Perhaps the most relevant emotion I could put a name to is…_grief?_

Seeing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy—a man who has sacrificed so much and endured so much suffering on behalf of his people—get "dressed down" by a raving madman lunatic and his pissy poor-excuse-for-a-man sidekick VP who between them both wouldn't know true sacrifice, honor, or courage if it came up and bit them on their putrid asses…**all I can do is weep.**

_I weep for the people of Ukraine._

And I weep for us, the people of the United States of American who must endure the dismantling of everything we've ever known to be good and true.

Like Chris Hays said, American certainly has plenty of sins to answer for with a number of foreign policy blunders over the past 80 years of geo #politics. Our hands are far from clean. Yet there was never a wavering of at least _the public defense_ of the principles of fighting for democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.

Trump, that Asshat-in-Chief—who was voted into office based on a steaming pile of horseshit masquerading as factual content—has completely destroyed what little respect we might have had left. **It's gone. It's all gone.**

Every world democracy must now consider the U.S. a threat. _We are not safe._ And my people are not safe from our own government.

**This are dark, dark days…darker than any I've ever seen in my forty-some-odd years of life.** I really cannot say where it all goes from here. I…just…don't…know.
