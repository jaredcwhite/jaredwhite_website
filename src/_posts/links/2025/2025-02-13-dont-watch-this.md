  They say quality over quantity. I say **no quality, no quantity**.
  
  I truly believe that **inspiration is a myth**. Everyone's always trying to optimize, get better, achieve things, have a happier life…I think **flip that**. Do the opposite.

  I was always inspired by my low moments—crying in bed—and realizing I think somebody else wants to **feel this way too**.

This video by **Chris Hau**, well-known photography YouTuber and "influencer", is brilliantly done. A _masterclass_ in #creativity, you might say.
