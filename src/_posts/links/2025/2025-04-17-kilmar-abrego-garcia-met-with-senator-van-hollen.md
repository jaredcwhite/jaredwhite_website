  MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell details the breaking news of Maryland Sen. Van Hollen visiting Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador as an appeals court rejects Donald Trump’s attempt to halt the judge’s order to facilitate his return. Andrew Weissmann joins to discuss, saying that Abrego Garcia remains in jail because Trump “wants him there and is paying for him to be there.”

I have been riding high on this news all evening. Between the recent court rulings and this meeting _finally_ transpiring between Senator Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia, it is feeling more and more likely that the illegitimate Trump regime is due for a reckoning.

AG Pam Bondi [erroneously claims](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/ag-bondi-says-abrego-garcia-is-not-coming-back-237585989962) that Garcia is "not coming back to our country". As Lawrence O’Donnell so adroitly articulates, **we'll see about that.**
