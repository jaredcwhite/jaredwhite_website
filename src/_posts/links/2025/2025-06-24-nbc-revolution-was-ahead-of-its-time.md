  Unlike many of the most popular visions of the apocalypse, Revolution presented a remarkably grounded catastrophe. No cordyceps fungus is exerting mind control over the human population. No nuclear winters or improbable genetic mutations are sweeping the planet. Eric Kripke eschewed all of pop culture’s most common explanations for societal collapse. Instead of natural disasters, warfare, or zombies, Revolution envisions a world without electricity.

_Revolution_ was one of those #TVShows which came along in that awkward phase post-LOST when every traditional network wanted to come out with their own high-concept binge-watch drama destined for streaming. Unfortunately we weren't yet in the thick of the streaming wars, and it didn't fare well in "primetime" and was canceled after two seasons. I can't help but wonder how a _Revolution_ might have fared if it'd been a fully-funded Apple TV+ or HBO Max production.

Nevertheless, I'm slowly working my way through a rewatch of Season 1 right now and still enjoying it thoroughly. I will always have fond memories of experiencing _Revolution_ in its day—for a variety of reasons but most notably because it was my introduction to the powerhouse that is **Giancarlo Esposito**. His work in the role of Captain Tom Neville is truly a performance for the ages. **Chewing scenery like a boss!**
