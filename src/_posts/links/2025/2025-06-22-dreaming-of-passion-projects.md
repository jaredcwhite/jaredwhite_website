title: Dreaming of Passion Projects

  August C. BourrÃ©: A forum I'm on has a "stupid ideas" thread, in which people talk about passion projects they doubt they'll ever realize because they are, typically, labour and capital intensive with virtually no hope of generating a reasonable income, or even any income at all. Pretty much all of them involve making art, food, labour, care, and space available to the public in a thoughtful way. None of them are about phones, computers, or "tech." The world needs these stupid ideas.

This is _so-o-o-o_ true for me, you wouldn't believe it.

My whole adult career has been working in "tech" as a software developer. Yet throughout this entire span of multiple decades, I have had a million and one things **I actually care about** I want to work on which are only tangentially-at-best related to "tech". And I'd certainly be doing a bunch of those things right the fuck now if, y'know, money were no object.

Bear in mind I'm not talking about things people do for leisure, as a hobby, when they retire, etc. I'm talking about **real work projects**. Like opening an electronic music venue. Founding a meditation retreat center. Showing gallery-quality fine art figure photography. A line of off-the-wall herbal-infused organic juices. A new "van life" campground in the desert outside Bend, Oregon.

Trust me, I have enough ideas bouncing around my brain to last several lifetimes, and many of them I've already been dreaming of for many years. Whatever I'm lacking in life, #creativity ain't it. ðŸ˜…

**So the question is:** how long is it going to take before I _snap_ and just start _doing_ one or more of these things? Perceived limitations and obstacles be damned? ðŸ¤”
