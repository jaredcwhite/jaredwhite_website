We're quickly approaching the release date of the latest of the **Captain America** Marvel #movies and the first one starring Mackie in the titular role, and instead of talking about what might actually be interesting about the film, we're arguing about (and this is just my opinion) _really dumb stuff because Welcome to America circa 2025_—and in a way, proving the exact point in Mackie's original statement.

You can read the article to see what he initially said, which I have no problem with, and his follow-up to attempt to defuse controversy. I also appreciated [this clip by the John Campea Show crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKWkHR-GWgE) where they did a fine job coming to Anthony Mackie's defense. The **TL;DR**: Captain America represents the ideal qualities of a hero that America should aspire to, not "America" in some geopolitical sense. And as many commenters point out, we should remember that in both _Captain America: Civil War_ and _The Avengers: Infinity War_, Steve Rogers (Captain America!) was an **outlaw** on the run from his own government!

So yeah, I think anyone trying to take Mackie's original statement as some kind of malicious dig at America or an attempt to distance oneself from appropriate patriotism is **reading way too much into it**, which says a whole lot more about them than it does about Anthony Mackie.
