title: No Joy, It’s the Cars that are Dangerous, Not the Pedestrians

  “Pedestrians crossing the street wherever they like....& rarely looking up to see if any traffic is on the road. It's just stupid & lazy, not to mention dangerous. I don't want to see anyone get hit by a car or be a driver who hits a pedestrian. Suck it up, walkers! Walk yourself to the nearest crosswalk, look both ways & cross when it is safe to do so. Thanks.” — Hey Portland reader Joy M.

As a pedestrian who regularly crosses streets and not always at crosswalks, I am here to inform you I am not stupid, nor lazy, nor dangerous.

**Automobiles are dangerous.**

Thankfully, #Portland _does_ have a culture in many areas of town (more so near city center, less so in the outer suburbs) where drivers are kind to pedestrians who are about to step out into the street, and they come to a safe stop to let people pass. I'm proud that our city has a thriving #micromobility scene with bikes, scooters, and other human-scale vehicles of all sorts sharing space with cars.

If it were up to me, I'd close off *many dozens of streets* in and around city center and create a large number of additional pedestrianized urban spaces. We have some already, but _far_ too few when you look at comparable cities in Europe and elsewhere. Hopefully with the new 2025 leadership elected to city council, we'll see progress on this front.

**P.S. Suck it up, Joy!**
