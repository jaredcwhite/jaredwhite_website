  Now I havenâ€™t been on planet Earth all that long but I have learned a few things along the way. Iâ€™ve observed there are a couple of key ingredients that successful individuals seem to have mastered: 

  **1.** Learn to develop extremely focused and valuable instincts for what you want to achieve in life and how to achieve it.  
  **2.** Trust your instincts.

  Recently I spent some serious time reviewing the last 10 years of my life, and I noticed a pattern. Every time things seemed to go sideways and my plans took months (or years) to get back on track, it was because, essentially, **I lost the nerve to go after my dreams.**

I was having fun over on [The Internet Review](https://theinternet.review/2025/03/10/my-rah-rah-of-web-2.0-aged-poorly/) linking to myself from 20 years ago, and then I thought why let that site have all the fun? ðŸ˜‚ So here's me from 10 years agoâ€¦and honestly, I agree with me! It's only proven to be _more true_ now that I'm a decade olderâ€¦and blame my more recent forays into **Taoism** if you want to understand just how much stock I put into letting "flow states" dictate my focus and my decision-making on a daily basis.

Now that might sound like a contradiction in termsâ€”let life unfold vs. chase after your dreams, but the way I look at it is my dreams are what my heart knows to be true about who I am and _why_ I amâ€”yet there's that constant pressure to logic your way out of those crazy ideas into other plans which are "sensible". _Nope to that!_ **You can't logic your way to happiness.** It just doesn't work like that.

"If anyone wants to take the world and directs it at his will, I do not see how he can succeed.  
The world is a sacred vessel, which cannot be directed at one's will.  
To direct it is to fail.  
To grasp it is to lose it.  
Some things go ahead, some follow, some breathe slowly, some breathe fast,  
some are strong, some are weak, some grow in strength, some decay.  
Therefore, the sage avoids 'very', 'too' and 'extreme'."  
â€“_Tao Te Ching, [Chapter 29](https://www.egreenway.com/taoism/ttclz29.htm)_
