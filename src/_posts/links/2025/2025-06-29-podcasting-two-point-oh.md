For quite some time, it felt like the things a "podcast" can do (that is, a real one, as in distributed via RSS) hadn't really changed in a long time. The medium was good, but it wasâ€¦stagnant.

**That seems to be changing!** I'm just starting to wrap my head around some of the aspects of the **Podcasting 2.0** initiative, but there's lots of exciting stuff on the horizon and some features are already available in certain apps and platforms. I hope to dive more into it soon and do a writeup for [The Internet Review](https://theinternet.review).
