  Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan has railed against the recent UK Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman by biological sex.

  In a passionate conversation at the Palais des Festivals during Canneseries this evening in France, Coughlan criticized the “hypothesized, made-up thing about trans women attacking women in bathrooms” and said this is “ridiculous because it is not something that is happening.”

Would that more stars with a measure of clout would come out this forcefully against the cynical nonsense-peddlers who paint trans women as a widespread threat against women. **Spoiler alert:** it's cis #gender men who are the threat far more than trans women, as Coughlan so rightly argues.

I find it truly a shame that the UK Supreme Court would issue any kind of ruling based on **bigotry and fear-mongering**, rather than science and civil rights. _Everyone_ in the LGBTQ+ community is at risk with these backwards lurches into far-right propaganda, but trans people in particular are the most vulnerable. **They deserve our utmost consideration and respect.**
