There are three fandoms which I find utterly exhausting. _Star Wars_ (though now that we have Andor it's gotten much better), _Star Trek_ (the ridiculous vitriol against "Nu-Trek" makes my ears bleed), and the _Snyderbros_. On that last point in particular, I'm sorry but I personally find little to admire about Zack Snyder's DC work. I honestly didn't like _Man of Steel_ all that much. I **hated** _Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice_ with a passionâ€”although bringing Gal Gadot on board to play Wonder Woman was an excellent move. I thought the theatrical release of _Justice League_ was merely OK, and the **long-awaited** Snydercut just didn't improve it much. Sorry.

So hear me when I say **my body is ready** for the whole new slate of DCU #movies with James Gunn at the helm (producing, and in the case of _Superman_, directing). I'm not saying I love every single aspect of Gunn's comic book movie work to date, but there's no denying the _Guardians of the Galaxy_ series was a massive success within the MCU, and _The Suicide Squad_ was infinitely more entertaining than the previous _Suicide Squad_ (a movie which I found near unwatchable).

I am **very excited** for the new _Superman_ movie and will of course go see it as soon as it's out in theaters.
