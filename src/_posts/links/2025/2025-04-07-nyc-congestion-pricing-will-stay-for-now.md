  The MTA and the Trump administration have reached an agreement that could keep New York City congestion pricing in place into the fall.

  After pulling authorization of the program just weeks after it was launched, the federal government initially insisted on a March 21 deadline for the MTA to shut the cameras off. That line in the sand was eventually pushed back 30 days. However, it has since been revealed in a court filing that both parties have agreed to hold off on the April 20 deadline until at least October.

  The proposed timeline would give both sides time to finalize their motions to the judge, who will then have the final say on the future of the controversial tolling program.

So much for all that performative nonsense about "long live the king" which really went over with New Yorkers like a lead balloon. ðŸ™„

Anyway, this is excellent news and provides a lengthy period of additional time where more data can be collected and analyzed proving the Congestion Relief Zone tolling has been **one of the most successful projects to decrease car dependency** in a dense urban core in American history.
