  The main campaign arm for House Democrats beat its Republican counterpart in fundraising in February, a bright spot for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries following intra-party discord over the recent government funding fight.

  The Democrats Congressional Campaign Committee raised $11.1 million to $9.2 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee, according to reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission.

I'm sorry, but analyzing which party is doing a better job of fundraising is a _terrible_ barometer of what is _actually_ happening when it comes to grassroots momentum in #politics.

I constantly heard throughout the bulk of 2024 about how much better the Democratic Party was doing with its fundraising vs. the Republican Party. It was viewed as a sort of shorthand as to which party had the winds of political fortune at its back.

**Turned out to be a load of rubbish.**

Honestly, I think the Dems should tighten their belts. They _should_ be the party of "fiscal responsibility". They should be learning how to do more with less. They should get **scrappy**â€”learn to speak to people on the ground in ways which are frugal, yes, and also _fucking effective_.

The pro-Trump media kicked our asses last year. This year _may_ shape up to be different. The MediasTouch Network certainly seems to get it. Unfortunately, I'm not yet sure the DNC does.
