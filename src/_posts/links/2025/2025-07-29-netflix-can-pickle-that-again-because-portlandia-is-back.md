  _Portlandia_ not only struck comedy gold, but also quickly established itself as one of the best sketch comedies in recent years. The show holds an impressive 81% audience score and 94% critics rating on _Rotten Tomatoes_.
  
  Verne Gay wrote for _Newsday_ that the series [leads] “Brownstein and Armisen move so effortlessly between characters, then execute their riffs, tics, styles and voices with such skilled abandon that before long this doesn’t seem like satire any longer but a fun house mirror reflection of intensely real people.”
  
  The show also received high praise from sitcom great Jerry Seinfeld, who told _Vulture_ in 2014, “It’s just too beyond brilliant…I think that’s the best comedy on TV right now, and it’s easily one of the best comedies of all time.”

The most mid-2010s Millennial cultural comedic touchstone I can think of, other than perhaps _Girls_, is _Portlandia_. And now **you can [put birds on things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHmLljk2t8M) once more** because **The Dream of the (18)90s is Alive in #Portland** (and also Netflix)!!!

I remain an **unabashed fan** of this sketch #comedy which took the world by storm in its heyday. [As I once wrote](/articles/what-its-like-to-live-in-portlandia) a mere two months into 2020 before Covid hit, _Portlandia_ had been a major factor in piquing my interest in this city and eventually moving here. And now, five years and one global pandemic later…well, I remain every bit the fan I was of both the show and the city which inspired it.

If you haven't yet had the distinct pleasure of enjoying every single episode of this uproariously off-the-wall show and the myriad of kooky characters which pop up at alarming frequency…well then **run, don't walk** over to your television set and press PLAY on _Portlandia_.
