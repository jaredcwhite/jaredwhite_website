  Following his request to meet with Salvadoran President Bukele and his announced intent to visit El Salvador earlier this week, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) released the following statement this evening, announcing his departure for El Salvador tomorrow:

  ‚ÄúFollowing his abduction and unlawful deportation, U.S. federal courts have ordered the safe return of my constituent Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States. It should be a priority of the U.S. government to secure his safe release, which is why tomorrow I am traveling to El Salvador. My hope is to visit Kilmar and check on his wellbeing and to hold constructive conversations with government officials around his release. We must urgently continue working to return Kilmar safely home to Maryland.‚Äù

I think the Democrats are finally starting to **get it**.

We're done with speeches and charts and sternly-worded memos. We're asking you to **get in the fight** and make audacious spectacle that is messy and uncouth and raw and real. Become the story. Become unignorable. Take control of the narrative and wrest it away from the MAGA propagandists.

Senator Van Hollen, I salute you. ü´° Godspeed on your travels and I hope you can get to the bottom of what's really happening to Kilmar Abrego Garcia and aid in _bringing him home_. #politics
