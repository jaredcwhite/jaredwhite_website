  Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) is back — but he’s never been one to give up without a fight. “You” was a pre-pandemic megahit, exploding on Netflix after the first season in 2018 and gripping viewers around the world with the story of a stalker turned lover turned killer based on the novels by Caroline Kepnes. The character isn’t exactly charming, but he’s eminently watchable, thanks to star Badgley — to the point that the actor had to explicitly tell viewers not to root for Joe. Because he and the showrunners were always clear about their moral standing, “You” entered the world as the streaming era’s dream show: thoroughly engrossing, full of juicy twists, and irresistible to binge.

Perhaps you're already ahead of me and finished watching this season! But if not, this primer on what's happened thus far may prove helpful. I found the last fourth season to be rather disappointing and somewhat confusing, but eight episodes into this final season and it's one of my very favorites of the show! Sure, plot-wise it's all rather ridiculous at this point if realism is your goal, but—well, it _kills_ if you like things on the pulpy side.

"You" has and continues to be one of my favorite Netflix #tvshows. Once the series is all done and some time has passed, I can definitely envision going through a full rewatch.
