title: Reflections on My Reflections

  There is no photo of myself I hate more than this one (taken in the Fall of 2014). If I were captured by an Evil Mastermind, they could force me to divulge all my deepest darkest secrets by threatening to release this photo to my friends and loved ones. (**But HAHA HA, the jokeâ€™s on you Evil Mastermind!** Iâ€™ve preemptively published this for the whole world to see! _Bwha ha ha!_ Ha. Ha?)

I am linking to my own article from three years ago which is a reflection on a then nearly 10-year-old photo because I've had one hell of a week and a particularly shitty day to top it all off but I still need to fulfill my **daily blogging** quota. This is my cheat code. Clever, no?

OK fine, I'll add one more thought. We never stop getting mad at our past selves sometimes. The _if-onlys_ pile up. Once in a while, it's a good practice to gather up all the _if-onlys_ into a pile and then stomp them to bits. _Kick 'em to the curb._ I've been doing a lot of nonjudgmental reflecting as part of my #mindfulness exercises thus far this year ([travel sure is good for that!](https://jaredwhite.com/tag/nomadlifestyle/)), and it's felt really, really good.

Out with the old, in with the new. **Reinvention.**

I think it's a cycle that only ends when we die. Some people die before they die, because they cease to reinvent themselves. I've never wanted to be that person.

So who's the Jared we'll uncover in 2035? **Check back with me in a decade!** ðŸ˜„
