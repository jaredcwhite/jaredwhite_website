link_excerpt: |
  As relations between the long-time allies who share the world's longest land border reach a new low, Trudeau told a news conference he was slapping tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of U.S. goods. Those on C$30 billion will take effect on Tuesday, the same day as Trump's tariffs, and duties on the remaining C$125 billion in 21 days, he said.
  
  Trudeau's announcement came just hours after Trump ordered 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and 10% on goods from China, risking a trade war that economists say could slow global growth and reignite inflation.

This is all so goddamn fucking stupid I can't believe it. MAGA's one claim to fame, besides hating trans people and brown people I guess, was that "Joe Biden's economy" was in the shitter and the average hardworking American couldn't afford to buy a dozen eggs or fill up their monster truck's gas tank because everything was oh so expensive. _Inflation inflation inflation._

And despite anyone with half a brain understanding that Trump's genius plan to implement tariffs would make the situation get _worse_ not better, MAGA managed to spew enough bullshit to convince voters it was all going to be just fine thatâ€¦well, here we are.

It's all so fucking stupid. The world is watching the United States of America get pillaged & plundered by goddamn fucking delusional idiots. I guess I'll just get used to eating ramen and a couple slices of cucumber like a student, and good luck driving anywhere with soaring prices for fuel. **Yeehaw!** ðŸ¤
