title: Tech Won’t Save Us (Recommended Episodes)
link_url: https://www.techwontsave.us
link_excerpt: |
  Tech Won’t Save Us challenges the notion that tech alone can drive our world forward by showing that tech is inherently political and ignoring that has serious consequences. It encourages listeners to think beyond the confines of the capitalist tech industry, to consider how we can dismantle oppressive technologies, and how technology can be developed for the public good.

Paris Marx has had a string of fantastic guests on his show lately. Some of the standouts:

* [The Case for a Digital Detox w/Casey Johnston](https://www.techwontsave.us/episode/278_the_case_for_a_digital_detox_w_casey_johnston) — _if you listen to any of them, listen to this one!_
* [Generative AI is Not Inevitable w/Alex Hanna & Emily M. Bender](https://www.techwontsave.us/episode/277_generative_ai_is_not_inevitable_w_emily_m_bender_and_alex_hanna)
* [How Brainrot AI is Upending the Internet w/Jason Koebler](https://www.techwontsave.us/episode/274_how_brainrot_ai_is_upending_the_internet_w_jason_koebler)

I'll also give a shout out to a great interview I recently enjoyed on _Better Offline_ hosted by Ed Zitron:

* [Empires of AI w/Karen Hao](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-better-offline-150284547/episode/empires-of-ai-with-karen-hao-275463277/)

These are smart people with real expertise providing reasonable and well-researched commentary. I know, I know—**quite the rarity in today's clout-makes-right world!**
