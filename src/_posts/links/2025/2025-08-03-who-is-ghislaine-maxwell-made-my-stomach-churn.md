Like so many ordinary blokes I suppose, I had no clear idea of who Ghislaine Maxwell is other than the bits and pieces of news reports I'd seen over the years. She was mixed up with Jeffrey Epstein and was found to have engaged in sex trafficking. That was the extent of my knowledge, and I didn't feel particularly compelled to dig into it further…

…until the bizarre situation we know find ourselves in when _suddenly_ Ghislaine Maxwell is lifted from a Florida federal prison housing 800 inmates (men and women) and _transferred_ to a cushy minimum-security women-only white-collar compound giving off "resort" vibes located in Texas, amidst swirling rumors that Trump might pardon her. There was also the [awful news earlier this year](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/virginia-giuffre-one-jeffrey-epsteins-prominent-abuse-survivors-dies-s-rcna203027) that Virginia Giuffre, a victim of Epstein & Maxwell, had taken her own life.

Given this horrific backdrop, when I was browsing through Starz and saw the 2022 documentary _Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell?_ appear, I immediately watched it…and what I saw made my stomach churn.

It is quite clear to me that Maxwell was a frequent sexual abuser in her own right and every bit Epstein's equal in the monster department. Nobody in their right mind would be considering giving Maxwell the slightest consideration now that she's a convicted sex offender and trafficker of girls—EXCEPT that her world and the world of #politics intersects at the highest level: the U.S. Presidency. The whole sordid affair is ghastly, and my only hope is the more Trump digs his own grave trying to save his skin by indirectly protecting Ghislaine Maxwell, the more the whole truth _and nothing but the truth_ comes to full light. **Justice has yet to be fully served.**
