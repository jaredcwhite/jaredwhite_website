  Apple, like every other big player in tech, is scrambling to find ways to inject AI into its products. Why? *Well, it’s the* *future!* What problems is it solving? *Well, so far that’s not clear!* Are customers demanding it? *LOL, no.* In fact, last year the backlash against one of Apple’s early ads for its AI was so hostile the company had to pull the commercial.

  The real reason companies are doing this is because Wall Street wants them to.

I'm not in the habit of linking to CNN regularly, but this is just _so_ good. Author Allison Morrow, a Senior Writer for CNN Business, has summed up the situation with Apple's disastrous, botched rollout of "Apple Intelligence" as not merely a goof unique to Apple but systemic to the entire #GenerativeAI technology space.

My favorite quote, as she responds to Kevin Roose' blethering about how Apple should "keep pushing AI into its products and just get used to the idea that those features may be unpolished and a little too advanced for the average user", her comeback:

"To what end?"

**Exactly.**
