  Exactly where Drake landed on the West Coast in 1579 has been hotly debated for decades. A Wikipedia page lists more than 40 possible locations, from Alaska to Mexico.

  California has perhaps the biggest claim, based on findings of old pottery and other artifacts at Point Reyes. The National Park Service even named one area Drakes Bay.

  But Melissa Darby, a research scholar in the anthropology department of Portland State University, says her reading of an old document in the British Museum indicates Drake likely landed in Oregon, not California.

Even though the story goes on to indicate there's still a good chance Northern California (near Point Reyes) was indeed the landing site for Elizabethan privateer Sir Francis Drake, I find this whole line of inquiry absolutely wild—in the good and fascinating sense. _I grew up in Marin County_, and hearing the tales of tall ships arriving on the coast and meeting with the Coast Miwok was an integral part of my childhood.

Now it's possible Drake instead sailed to Whale Cove, mere miles south of one of my favorite towns along the Oregon coast, Lincoln City?! **It truly boggles the mind.**
