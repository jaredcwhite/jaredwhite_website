link_excerpt: In the weeks since January 20, the US information ecosystem has been unraveling fast. (We're looking at you Denali, Gulf of Mexico, and every holiday celebrating people of color and queer people that used to be on Google Calendar.) As the country's unelected South African tech billionaire continues to run previously secure government data through highly questionable LLMs, academic librarian Raina Bloom joins Emily and Alex for a talk about how we organize knowledge, and what happens when generative AI degrades or poison the systems that keep us all accurately -- and contextually -- informed.

I've been wanting to link to an episode of _Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000_ for some time now, and **this one seemed particularly noteworthy** as the hosts and their lively guest really dove down deep into questions of fact-finding, truth-telling, and what it means to have legitimate authority as a conveyer of educational and informative information.

Why are the Big Tech companies behind today's #generativeAI chatbots ascribing "agency" to technologies which cannot and will not ever posses such an attribute? And why do people credulously consider these "synthetic text extruders" (to use a phrase often heard on the show) to be conveying anything resembling a point of view wholly separate from the providers of such services?

**Well worth the watch** ([or the listen if you so prefer](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2126417/episodes/16735740-the-war-on-knowledge-with-raina-bloom-2025-02-24)).
