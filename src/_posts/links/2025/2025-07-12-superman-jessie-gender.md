  This is who Superman was always meant to be. He's supposed to be one of us…like a guy that's one of us but he actually has power and he actually cares for other people. He's not there for power for power's sake because he doesn't need it. (YouTube)

Confession time: I haven't though much of any of the Superman #movies made in the last 20 years. (And I actually never saw the originals with Christopher Reeve.) Honestly, the character has never made a whole lot of sense to me. Maybe I'd feel differently if I'd read some of the comic book source material. In terms of live action portrayals, I just never "got" Superman.

**Until now.**

James Gunn pulled a rabbit out of his hat with this film. He not only made me care, deeply, about _Superman_ of all people, but he somehow crafted a story that feels fun and funny in a truly goofball way—yet also resonates on a deep level in some incredibly smart ways which are fully relevant to the zeitgeist. We're having a _conversation_ about who Superman is and what he stands for and it's reflecting back on who we are and what we want to stand for as leaders here in the real world.

I'm kind of shocked this is the case, but when you really think about it, _that's the whole point_ of having these mythic stories. They're _supposed_ to be a reflection of our hopes and our fears, our aspirations and our foibles. It's not just dumb entertainment…although let's not get too academically carried away, **this movie is very entertaining in the vein of Hollywood summer blockbusters**.

Personally? I can't wait to go see it again.
