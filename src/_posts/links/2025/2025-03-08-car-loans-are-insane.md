  ‚ÄúHigher car prices combined with higher interest rates have driven monthly payments upward and have put pressure on consumers across the income and credit score spectrum,‚Äù researchers at the New York Fed wrote.

  The cost of buying a new car has risen more than $10,000 since the pandemic, from roughly $38,000 in  January 2020 to more than $48,500 in January 2025, according to Cox Automotive data.

  Elevated interest rates have added to the pain, pushing up the cost of financing in recent years.
 
  The average monthly payment for a new car loan was $755 in January ‚Äî down from the $795 peak in December 2022 but well above the $566 average in 2019, per Cox Automotive.

**$755 a month?!** ü§Ø

I have absolutely no idea how anyone can afford that.

The most I ever paid for a car payment was somewhere in the $300s‚Äîand that wasn't even for a new car but a used (pre-owned from the dealer). And that was _quite_ the stretch at times, let me tell you. I thankfully paid off the loan a few years ago and I thankfully still own the car. It's the second car I _ever_ bought in my life. I will run this car straight into the ground (hopefully long into the future).

**Car pricing has gone completely insane.** We need _small, cheap EVs_ (sub-$20,000) and we need them yesterday. (Also yet another plug for the miracle of #micromobility.)
