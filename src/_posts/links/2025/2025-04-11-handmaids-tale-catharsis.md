  “The Handmaid’s Tale” premiered in 2017, six months before the #MeToo movement erupted. In 2022, Roe v. Wade was overturned.

  “As a woman, I have fewer rights now than when I started on the show,” says showrunner Yahlin Chang. “I never thought that we would lose Roe v. Wade, even working on the show … And that does start to get infused into our writing.”

One of my most anticipated #TVShows coming to a conclusion this year (along with [Star Wars: Andor](/links/20250303/putting-the-wars-in-star-wars)) is _The Handmaid's Tale_.

I have **a lot of thoughts** about my experience watching this final season in a year such as 2025 and how the show relates to Our Present Moment™, but I'm saving that for a **Fresh Fusion** podcast episode to be released very soon. As the saying goes: _stay tuned!_
