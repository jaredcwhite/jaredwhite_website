  **The End Table:** This is a portrait of my grandparent's table that they shared. It's where they lived a great deal of their lives, and it holds so many hints of the life they lived together and apart. It's hopes and dreams and death and love. Tempus fugit. We all get old and we have all done good and bad and we have secrets and vices. What do you do with your last days on earth? What secrets do you keep, and what ghosts of yourself do you leave behind?

I've followed Jeremy off-and-on since the 90s when he was one of the 3D game artists who worked on the G.O.A.T., **Riven**. (He's long since held a significant position at Dreamworks Animation.)

But this is truly _next-level_ work. I encourage you to experience **The End Table** and then click back to his full gallery on Artstation, as well as take a peak at [his older DeviantArt gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/jeremyengleman). Breathtaking.

_Fun fact:_ also back in the 90s, I hosted a Web site called [The Digital Fine Art Gallery](https://web.archive.org/web/19991105050138/http://www.gaeldesign.adei.com/gallery/jengleman.html) where I featured some of his then-new work alongside more #obscureartists. Alas, most of those image links are broken, but this should tell you just how much his work has meant to me over the years.
