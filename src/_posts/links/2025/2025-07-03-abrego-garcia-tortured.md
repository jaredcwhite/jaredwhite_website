I know there's so much to be horrified by in U.S. #politics right now, but a story I've been following very closely for some while now has been the plight of **Kilmar Abrego Garcia**; husband, father, union worker, and perhaps most importantly, a man with no criminal record!

He's currently on U.S. soil, thank god, but his future remains very much up in the air due to the despicable actions of the Trump regime, and **we must hope fervently the courts are able to keep him here** and not allow his deportation back to a gulag in El Salvador—or worse.
