  Businesses and manufacturers in the state rely on imported goods and parts to run companies ranging from furniture shops to computer chip factories. Meanwhile, Oregon farmers, fishers and manufacturers rely on international buyers’ interest in their products. And shipping and storage companies generate business by helping move these imports and exports around.

  All told, last year Oregon imported more than $28 billion worth of goods, and sent more than $34 billion worth of stuff to global markets.

This deep dive analysis by Kyra Buckley, business reporter at Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB), is absolutely fascinating. I honestly had no idea that Oregon exported more than it imported in global trade—particularly that "more than 80% of the soft, white wheat grown in Eastern Oregon is sold overseas for products ranging from noodles and dumplings to crackers."

All of this is affected now by the trade wars. Not only must we contend with rising prices for imports, but Oregon's exports are threatened by retaliatory tariffs other countries impose on those imports coming in.

One of our more famous food brands is **Bob's Red Mill**, maker of many fine whole grain and baking products. Well, CEO Trey Winthrop has been sounding the alarm about how the company's exports are being affected:

> Bob’s Red Mill products can also be found on shelves in 65 countries. But Winthrop told Governor Tina Kotek that he’s seeing campaigns in countries like Canada encouraging consumers to stop buying American goods in response to Trump’s tariffs.

As I keep snarking on Mastodon: **Good job MAGA!** 😃👍
