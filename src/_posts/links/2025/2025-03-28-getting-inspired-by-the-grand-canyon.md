  Sarah Berkowitz: Good morning everyone! I'm in the Grand Canyon and I'm super excited about that because when I was 14 I went on a teen tour and that summer I visited two national parks, Yellowstone and Grand Canyon. Over a decade later I am finally back and I honestly don't remember this park at all so I'm super excited to check it out today!

I feel pretty silly that I'm a grown man, in my 40s, living on the west coast of the U.S. of A., and I've *never* been to the Grand Canyon nor have I ever been to Yellowstone! I've also lived in Oregon for close to a decade now and I still haven't been to Crater Lake!

One of the reasons I'm so thrilled to be on my #NomadLifestyle journey is I can _finally_ start crossing off bucket items like this. üòç
