Oh I simply eat this stuff up. Back in the 2000s my web design work was heavily influenced by old Celtic art ([as you can see here courtesy of The Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20040604022451/http://www.gaeldesign.com/gallery.html)), and I've always had a fascination for medieval manuscripts as well as later movements which were inspired by that era such as the Pre-Raphaelites and to various degrees Arts & Crafts and Art Nouveau.
