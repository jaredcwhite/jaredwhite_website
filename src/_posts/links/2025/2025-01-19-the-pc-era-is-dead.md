title: The Death and the Resurrection of the Personal Computer

link_excerpt: |
  Americans have allowed runaway business models, empowered by tech, to subvert privacy and individual liberty on the road to making money. Our default tech business model has become extractive, like part of a strip-mining operation. Consumers—and now creative works (used for training AI)—are treated as a natural resource to be milked and exploited.
  
  The extractive model may end up being self-destructive for the tech industry itself. In the physical world, resource extraction needs limits and regulations to be sustainable. It can be wildly profitable until a resource becomes over-harvested, or the harvesting process corrupts the environment that lets the industry exist in the first place.

This entire essay by Benj Edwards over at Vintage Computing and Gaming is fantastic, but that section in particular stood out to me because I've been making the exact same analogy. #GenerativeAI companies are treating all human creative output on the Internet like it's merely raw material to extract out of the environment and repurpose for their paying\* customers. Who cares if the overall quality of software keeps decreasing and frequent #enshittification is the new normal? [Gotta keep the hype cycle, er, cycling!](https://buttondown.com/theinternet)

Benj's larger point about the lack of true **ownership** in today's computing landscape is worthy of a long and serious conversation, one I'll be having over at [The Internet Review](https://theinternet.review) in due course. There's something seriously, seriously wrong with software and media being totally ephemeral, morphing and even vanishing at the whims of the real owners (_not you!_), and it's high time we begin to wrest back control. _This essay gets it._

"It is possible to learn from history and integrate the best of today’s technology with fair business practices that are more sustainable and healthy for everyone in the long run." **Amen to that.**

\* There's actually legitmate debate to be had if any of these AI chatbots and assistants will even be profitable, because so far the answer is no. Hardware manufacturers and data center operators sure are making bank however!
