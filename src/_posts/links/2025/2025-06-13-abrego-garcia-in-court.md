  Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have characterized the smuggling case as a desperate attempt to justify the mistaken deportation. The investigation was launched weeks after the U.S. government deported Abrego Garcia and following a Supreme Court order and mounting pressure to return him.

  Abrego Garcia’s lawyers told a judge Friday that some government witnesses cooperated to get favors regarding their immigration status or criminal charges they were facing. A federal agent acknowledged during his testimony that one witness was living in the U.S. illegally with a criminal record and is now getting preferred status.

I'm glad Abrego Garcia is finally able to stand his ground and experience the proper unfolding of our justice system and the rule of law. While he is only one man among hundreds who has faced horrendous rights abuse at the hands of the Trump regime, **I hope his case continues to resonate with the public** and shine a light on what's really going on.

While I can't say with certainty Garcia is innocent of any and all crimes, the manner in which he has been accused certainly smells as fishy as a wharf on a hot day. **I don't trust the prosecution as far as I could throw 'em.**
