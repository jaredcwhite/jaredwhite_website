  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who visited Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, said his return to the U.S. was long overdue.
  
  “As I have repeatedly said, this is not about the man, it’s about his constitutional rights – and the rights of all,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement. “The Administration will now have to make its case in the court of law, as it should have all along.”

So…whatever happened to Pam "Abrego Garcia is never ever ever coming back" Bondi's [false bravado](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5251491-pam-bondi-kilmar-abrego-garcia-return/)? **You sure look real competent right about now!**

Oh and those trumped-up charges of human trafficking? I expect them to get tossed out. I totally believe Garcia is innocent. **At least he will now have his day in court** which is the bare minimum any of us were ever asking for.
