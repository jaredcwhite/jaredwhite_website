  For the first time ever, Seattle has officially surpassed the 800,000 population mark. The state Office of Financial Management (OFM) pegged Seattle at 816,600 residents in April 1, 2025 population estimates released Friday. This year marks the fifth straight that Seattle’s growth rate has exceeded 2%, making Seattle one of the fastest-growing cities in the country.

  As of April 2024, OFM estimated Seattle’s population was 797,700. The new estimates would indicate that Seattle added 18,900 residents in one year, growing 2.4% over the previous year.

For a while, it seemed to me that Seattle's rapid growth had far outpaced the ability of its transportation infrastructure to handle such demand. But they've made a lot of improvements to the roads as well as adding new train lines, bike lanes, and other transit options beyond the car, and on a recent trip to the Seattle area I felt the most relaxed I've been there in quite some time.

I hope as Seattle continues to grow they can continue to invest in public transit, micromobility, and other methods to keep the roadways from descending into utter madness. (I know it's tough in places because of the #geography of the natural landscape…for example, downtown Seattle is literally located in a bottleneck!)
