Nobody does person-on-the-street interviews like Don Lemon. He's just great at this stuff, and honestly that was the first clue I got back in October/early November 2024 that something was off about the Harris campaign. Don Lemon's interviews picked up on a thread of the zeitgeist I wasn't seeing anywhere else.

Lately he's been out asking lots of folks what they think about Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and the responses have been fascinating. It's incredibly apparent that they are tapping into a wing of the Democratic Party base which has been _supremely frustrated_ over the past couple of years. We desperately need an energetic, youth-focused, **center-left populist movement** in American #politics and the Dems would be wise to stop taking this demographic for granted. It's the kind of mojo the party needs in full force right now.
