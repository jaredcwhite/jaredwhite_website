  MSNBC is canceling Joy Reid’s evening news show as part of the network’s overhaul under the new presidential administration. Reid’s final show is planned for sometime this week, a source familiar with the changes said.
  
  Symone Sanders Townsend, Michael Steele and Alicia Menendez, who currently host the network’s “The Weekend,” will now be anchoring in Reid’s former 7 p.m. slot, sources at MSNBC said.

I like the crew at The Weekend, so I'm sure they'll do a fine job in their new weekday slot. But this news is surprising to me, as I always felt like Joy Reid was one of the strongest voices at the network, alongside Rachel Maddow. At the same time, I also felt like it would be a slam dunk for her to strike out on her own and go independent, like so many others have (Don Lemon for example). Truth be told, I rarely watch MSNBC anymore and prefer supporting independent broadcasters online. I suspect that is increasingly true across the whole industry.
