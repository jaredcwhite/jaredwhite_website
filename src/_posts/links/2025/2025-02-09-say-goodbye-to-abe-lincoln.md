link_excerpt: The cost of making a penny was nearly 3.7 cents in Fiscal Year 2024 and the coin has cost above face value to make for 19 consecutive fiscal years, according to the U.S. Mint’s annual report. Billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who has been tasked by Trump with cutting waste in the U.S., targeted the penny in a post on X last month.

In the grand scheme of things, this doesn't seem like a big deal to me. I can't remember the last time I actually _used_ a penny…they just sort of accumulate. The least value I tend to reach for is a dime. Other than the loss of seeing President Lincoln's profile on a copper, I won't miss the humble penny.

That being said…this seems like a pretty goofy thing to make like it's a huge win for "DOGE". But at this point it goes without saying: we're not dealing with serious people here. **They are all clowns of the tallest order.** And either way, 1¢ coins are inconsequential compared too the assault on our fundamental democratic freedoms and way of life.
