  Slate crossed the milestone over the weekend, just a little more than two weeks after coming out of stealth mode and unveiling the truck at an event in Los Angeles, California. The company has said the truck will start below $20,000 after applying the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and plans to build the vehicles at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana.

In a [recent post](/links/20250424/slate-truck-shows-real-ev-innovation), I shared my enthusiasm for the newly announced **Slate Truck**, and apparently I wasn't alone! As the article emphasizes, online buzz and a modest influx of cash doesn't guarantee the final product will be good (or even get madeâ€¦there is a long line of dead EV companies in Slate's wake), but I still say this is a good sign they've hit on a winning formula with broad appeal.
