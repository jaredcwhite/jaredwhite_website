  For the first time in her 45-year career, Demi Moore won a major film or TV award, taking home the Golden Globe for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy for her work in “The Substance.” Despite roles in films like “Ghost,” “G.I. Jane,” and “Indecent Proposal,” the star had never won, despite two prior Globe nominations and one Primetime Emmy nod.

  Finally that streak is over. And in an inspiring speech that was one of the highlights of the awards ceremony, Moore said that this win was validation that she’s no longer just a “popcorn actress” and deserves every minute of her laurels.

I'm so incredibly happy that Demi Moore won the Golden Globe for Best Female Actor (one of two winners, the Globes has two different movie categories: comedy & drama). [Watch her speech here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SvW3XJP5Ic).

I must admit I'm not too familiar with Demi Moore's past work, and before _The Substance_ if you'd asked me if her career was basically over—if she was "washed up"—I would have replied in the affirmative. And then I saw this film, and everything about it—including Moore's performance—was mind-altering. **I'll have a lot more to say** about _The Substance_ in my upcoming "Top 5 Violent #Movies of 2024" list (which I meant to get out before New Year's…I promise it's still in the works!), but suffice it to say, Demi Moore _absolutely deserves_ this award, and I'm rooting for her at the Academy Awards later this year as well (at least to get a nomination).

Another great win I liked seeing at the Golden Globes: _Challengers_ for best original movie score. Composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, **I've had this one on repeat** ever since seeing the film last month. Badass music for a badass production.
