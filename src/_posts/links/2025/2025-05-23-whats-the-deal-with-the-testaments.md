  While Huluâ€™s television adaptation of The Handmaidâ€™s Tale is soon coming to an end, the story will continue in sequel series The Testaments.

  From executive producers Bruce Miller and Warren Littlefield, the show will take place in the same world as The Handmaidâ€™s Tale with a time jump after the show.

It's difficult to claim I **enjoy** watching certain high-drama #tvshows like _The Handmaid's Tale_. It's more like I endure it. It's an experience you hate to love, and love to hate. (Doubly so when the show touches so heavily on #politics which feel eerily like the present day insanity we're all dealing with.)

So on a certain level, **I'm not looking forward** to watching this sequel show to _The Handmaid's Tale_. Do I really want to put myself through all thisâ€¦again? ðŸ˜…

And yet, I am definitely excited for it because if it appreciably manages to approach the quality level of its predecessor, it will be a worthy contender indeed for my viewing attention.
