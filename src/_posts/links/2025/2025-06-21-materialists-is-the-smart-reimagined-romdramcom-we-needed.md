  Watching writer-director Celine Song‘s follow-up to her feature debut, indie darling and 2023 Best Picture Oscar nominee _Past Lives_, all sorts of supposed cinematic influences ran through my mind from Billy Wilder’s _The Apartment_ to James L. Brooks’ _Broadcast News_ to Mike Nichols’ _Working Girl_ and just about anything from Nora Ephron. I left the screening thinking I had just seen the best movie about the search for love in many years.
  
  Call it a romcom, call it a romdram or any shorthand attempt to categorize it, but this is a movie that defies that kind of easy description.

I wouldn't actually recommend you read all of Pete Hammond's review for Deadline of _Materialists_ as it gives away too many spoilers (IMO), but I absolutely agree with his assessment that this is "the best movie about the search for love in many years."

Dakota Johnson gives a stellar performance in this film, perhaps her best out of the many #movies I've seen her in. (Truth be told, I'm a big Johnson fan, but I do think she can be a bit one-note. The sharp writing and expert direction in _Materialists_ gives her a lot to work with, and I was quite impressed by her range in this as I was Chris Evans as well.)

I'd heard a bit of the scuttlebutt about how this film has proven to elicit mixed responses from moviegoers—even though it's a hit with the critics (Certified Fresh!). **Personally, I was floored.** And I found myself feeling very emotional about it towards the end, no doubt as it resonated with some of my own very real and raw ups and downs in love.

I would typically say a movie in this "genre" isn't something you need to rush out to go see in movie theaters (wait for the streaming release). **However, this is A24 we're talking about, with Academy Award nominee Celine Song at the helm.**

Go see it.
