  DMVs across the country are warning drivers of a new batch of fake, phishing text messages, designed to scam respondents out of their personal and financial information.
  
  The latest round of scam texts have been reported by departments of motor vehicles in at least three states: New York, Florida and California.

I can confirm I have also received these scam text messages. For a brief moment, it seemed like it could be legit, but then I took a closer look at the domain names listed and as is typical with spam like this, they were all wonky with bogus words and strange characters.

I'm guessing anyone who falls prey to these doesn't understand how domain names workâ€”which, alas, is a significant percentage of the population.
