  Slate is presenting its truck as minimalist design with DIY purpose, an attempt to not just go cheap but to create a new category of vehicle with a huge focus on personalization. That design also enables a low-cost approach to manufacturing that has caught the eye of major investors… It’s been engineered and will be manufactured in America, but is this extreme simplification too much for American consumers?

While Tesla literally crashes and literally burns, forever tarnished by the epic fail that is the "CyberTruck" (not to mention Elon's insanity), other EV companies are taking on the mantle of cool & different.

I _love_ seeing products like the **Slate Truck**. Historically I have been supremely disappointed at the conservatism of so many America-made EVs…and the nosebleed prices of most. But it feels like we're turning a corner. EVs have been around long enough and established long enough as real, viable automobiles, the market is ripe for a few quirky experiments. **I wish Slate the best of luck.**
