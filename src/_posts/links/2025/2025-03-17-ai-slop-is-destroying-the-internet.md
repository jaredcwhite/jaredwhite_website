title: AI Slop is Destroying Online Reality As We Know It

link_excerpt:
  I think we as a society need to realize that a huge portion of what is being done with generative AI tools is for the type of thing I have described in this article, or for nonconsensual, AI-generated intimate imagery. It is possible that generative AI will bring some of the work efficiencies and breakthroughs that venture capitalists and big tech have been hyping for years, but we must grapple with the fact that the main ways that people encounter generative AI is as brute force internet pollution.

There have been a handful of truly terrifying things I have read in my life. _1984_ was one of those things…a book I read once decades ago which still feels seared into my brain as one of the most horrendously frightening stories I have ever engaged with.

This essay by Jason Koebler of 404 Media (always a world-class outfit) approaches that level, and is perhaps even more petrifying because—unlike the fiction of _1984_—**this nightmare is actually happening**.

I see this issue in black and white. There is no nuance for me, no hemming and hawing required. **I think #generativeAI slop should be illegal.** I think it should be banned. Slop is simply a variant of spam, and just as I consider it wrong (and in some cases it is truly unlawful) to have my text messages or my email inbox filled up with spam, I feel exactly the same way about slop. I never want to see it, I will never purchase a product advertised by it, and I consider the people who produce it to be destructive agents who are degrading the integrity of the communications network that is the #openweb.

It is utterly absurd _in the extreme_ that commercial social networks allow this spam-slop to be disseminated en masse, and even more brain-melting that they _willingly provide tools to produce it and promote it_. There is no excuse. **This is villainous.** And while it's easy to get mad at the people who excitedly thump their chests over their "success" at slopifying the Internet and who will gleefully teach others how to exploit algorithms to make their putrid, vile slop go "viral"—ultimately the blame lies squarely at the feet of Big Tech commercial silo platforms who **refuse** to put an absolute and unwavering stop to this madness.

There's only one way out of this hellscape, only one escape hatch for us all, and that is to **boycott all of these platforms**\*. I won't be subjected to the _mental abuse_ that is consuming this kind of slop because I _refuse to frequent_ the avenues where it appears. I pray you too will find the strength and fortitude to make your hasty exit. **We cannot allow the destruction of the Internet to continue like this, not on our watch!**

\* I don't boycott YouTube per se, but I never watch Shorts and I generally subscribe and view certain videos through a third-party interface (Feedbin). Everything else is banned from my devices. **Permanently.**
