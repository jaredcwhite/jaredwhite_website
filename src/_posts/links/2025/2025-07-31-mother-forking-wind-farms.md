  At Vattenfall we collaborate with others to accelerate our work towards a future without fossil fuels. And now weâ€™ve teamed up with iconic actor and social justice advocate Samuel L. Jackson, who isnâ€™t afraid to tell it like it is.

I clicked away the first time I came across this video; thought it was some deepfake. Turns out, **that's really Samuel L. Jackson** and he's really talking about putting up wind farms in Europe like a mofo. ðŸ˜Ž

_I love it!_ And green energy (seaweed notwithstanding), [my latest Cycles Hyped No More newsletter](https://buttondown.com/theinternet/archive/the-truth-of-reliable-next-generation-green/) dove right into the topic of energy storage for renewables. Because if you keep hearing dumb shit like "the power goes out" when the wind dies down or the sun goes down, you might think, uh, that's absurdâ€¦_and you're right!_ But it doesn't hurt to know more about the projects which make these systems more feasible than ever.
