  “Madame Web underperformed in the theaters because the press just crucified it. It was not a bad film, and it did great on Netflix,” Vinciquerra told the Los Angeles Times. He also acknowledged that Kraven the Hunter underperformed like Madame Web and suggested, “for some reason, the press decided that they didn’t want us making these films … and the critics just destroyed them.”

_Oookaayyy……_

In the interests of full transparency, because why should you trust what I have to say if I'm unwilling to admit when I have been spectacularly wrong—[I wrote back on December 13](https://jaredwhite.com/20241213/kraven-the-hunter):

> I have a feeling [Kraven the Hunter] is going to be a slow but steady burn at the box office, and we’ll be surprised at the numbers when all is said and done.

Oh boy was I wrong! Kraven was a _miserable failure_ at the box office, so much so that the previous duds look like decent examples by comparison. If there was any surprise, it's that the numbers weren't just dismal, **they were pathetic**.

But as you can see by the quote up top, the CEO of Sony Pictures seems to be in complete denial about this fact, and prefers to gaslight us by saying it's not his fault his #movies did poorly, it's the fault of critics!

I won't even dignify that with a response, but if you're in the mood for an _epic_ rant on this score, check out [John Campea's take on Vinciquerra's comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgSKUS9_mXU). Lots of shouting and swearing involved, but it's very entertaining!
