title: "The Sparse Pacific Coast of Colombia"

  Coastal cities like Cartagena and Santa Marta were prioritized for settlement due to their proximity to other Caribbean colonies and Europe more broadly. In contrast, Colombiaâ€™s Pacific coast offered little to entice Spanish settlers. The region lacks major natural harbors and continues to face rough seas into today, making it less suitable for large-scale shipping. Additionally, trade routes with Asia and the Pacific Rim were virtually nonexistent during this period, further diminishing the regionâ€™s strategic importance.

I've been a fan of **Geography by Geoff** for some time now, and it certainly doesn't hurt that Geoff is a local Portlander! I can't think of any other source on the Internet that's helped me learn more about #geography and population growth (or lack thereof) in various regions, and this installment is no different.

**Aside:** I also think it's interesting that Geoff, like many YouTubers, is essentially blogging now with an email newsletter (hosted on Substack which isn't ideal, but stillâ€¦). I feel like that's a growing trend, because creators are realizing just because they have followers on a social media platform doesn't mean they have a direct relationship with their fans. **Blogging** is also a great way to get _key concepts_ out the door in a way that's easy to discuss and link to from other websites. Just like I'm doing right now! ðŸ˜Ž
