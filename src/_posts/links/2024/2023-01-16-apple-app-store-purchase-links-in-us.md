title: "Revised Apple App Store Guidelines Will Allow External Payment Links in the U.S."

link_excerpt: |
  Apple is updating its App Store guidelines to allow developers to link to alternative payment methods, provided that the app also offer purchases through Apple‚Äôs own In-App Purchase system.
  
  This means that an app can‚Äôt include links to alternative payment platforms if that app doesn‚Äôt also use Apple‚Äôs In-App Purchase system. The guideline says that developers can apply for an entitlement that allows them to include buttons or links directing users to out-of-app purchasing mechanisms.

It's progress. It's not enough, but it's **progress**.

Look, folks will argue about the various legalities of the #Apple App Store policies and whether or not the company has the right to control digital #payments to the extent they do. But I most certainly have a hard time sympathizing with anyone who sees Apple as taking the moral high ground on any of this stuff.

In an ideal world, I could buy whatever software I want, from whomever I want, and install that software on my iPad. Yes, I'm fine with bypassing a bajillion scary alerts and pressing a giant red blinking button in the middle of the screen that says "**YOU MIGHT GET A VIRUS!!!** ü¶†‚ò†Ô∏è". After all, I do this on my Mac all the time, and _it's fine_. Really, it is.

I absolutely _love_ using an iPad, but the lack of "sideloading" and alternative sources of software really grinds my gears sometimes. If I could boot up a VM and run Fedora Linux on my iPad‚Äîjust like I do on my Mac‚Äî**that would also be swell!**
