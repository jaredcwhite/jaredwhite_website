  Today, there was yet another school shooting, this time at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin. So far, 3 people are dead, and many are struggling to make sense of such a horrific tragedy.

In the absence of any mainstream media I care to watch or listen to these days, I've found some comfort in the broadcasts of Don Lemon. Ironically I never saw his work as an anchor at CNN, but started watching his YouTube show when it launched earlier this year. He certainly has "the voice", and a certain gravitas which I've come to appreciate—rare in online media centered around #politics.

And it's grave news indeed to be processing **once again**. It feels ludicrous to yet one more time offer thoughts and prayers, talk about what a terrible tragedy this is, wave hands up in the air about how teenagers shouldn't have access to guns, etc., etc.

All I can say is, this **Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Statistic** should be on air 24/7. It should be shoved in politicians’ faces. It should be plastered all over telephone polls in all the major cities. This, _this_ is the America we're asking our children (the ones who survive) to inherit. And it's despicable.

<span>83.</span> Eighty-three. **83!!** And all we can do is hope it's the last one before January rolls around.

**2024 is just the worst.**
