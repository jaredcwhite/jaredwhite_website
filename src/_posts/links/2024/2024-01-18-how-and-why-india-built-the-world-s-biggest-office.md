  Time for a quick quiz: what structure has over 7 million square feet of office space, houses nearly 70,000 workers and ranks as the largest office building in the world. If you guessed The Pentagon, then…you’re wrong.

  In December 2023 the title of world’s largest office building was taken from the Potomac polygon and handed to a gigantic new development in the Indian city of Surat. The outsized office comprises thousands of offices, 10,000 square metres of restaurants and cafes, parking for 5,000 cars and 10,000 motorbikes, 131 elevators, nine courtyard gardens, retail outlets and conference halls, all across a 35 acre, high security compound.

This whole video, as well as its [companion blog post](https://www.theb1m.com/video/surat-worlds-biggest-office-building), I found hugely fascinating. It's a stunning example of how the architecture of an unusual new building is uniquely suited to the place and the people for which it's intended. No surprise the complex has quickly turned into a popular tourist destination. I will specifically seek this out if I ever travel to India!
