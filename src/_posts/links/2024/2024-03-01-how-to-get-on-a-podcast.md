Great advice from noted <strong>#</strong>WebDev podcaster Dave Rupert. I'll add one more layer of commentary of top of the excellent points made in this article.

**Keep saying the same things repeatedly until you're sick of it.** 🤪

You know how folks complain about the weird quirk of human nature where if you hear somebody tell you the same lies over and over and over again, you start to believe them? Well if that's true for nonsense, grifts, and psyops, just think how even _more_ true that is for stuff that's thoroughly legit.

A long time ago I realized that I couldn't just voice a thought about an important topic once. _Haha! I wrote that single blog post! My job here is done!_ or _I posted this hot take one time! Never again!_ 😅

Gotta keep saying it. And saying it. And saying it. And saying it. Until you're sick of it. And then say it some more.

**Now you're an expert. Congratulations!** 😜
