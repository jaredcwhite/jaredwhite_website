title: Nomadland Won Best Picture at the Golden Globes and I Had No Idea
link_url: https://world.hey.com/jaredwhite/nomadland-won-best-picture-at-the-golden-globes-and-i-had-no-idea-1900ccda
link_excerpt: It absolutely deserved the accolades, because *Nomadland* is very, very
  good. It is an outstanding character study, a moving tribute to love and loss, and
  a respectful look at an alternative lifestyle that's part-tragedy, part-refuge.
