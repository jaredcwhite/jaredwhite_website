  The "free speech" argument is toxic garbage that horrible people use to justify being horrible people.

  "Free speech" means you don't go to jail for being an asshole, it doesn't mean others have to put up with you. If you're going to put up with assholes, I'm not interested.

This excellent tweet by [Hector Martin](https://twitter.com/marcan42) sums up the bewildering lack of understanding many people—including the (likely) new owner of #Twitter, Elon Musk!—seem to have around the moderation of online speech.

Obviously I don't want government goons arriving on your doorstep to haul you away if you're just spouting off racist / homophobic / transphobic / misogynistic (etc.) garbage. **You certainly have the right to be a trash human.** _However_, you do _not_ have the right to invade an online space _I've_ chosen to participate in which purports to follow specific moderation rules. Twitter has been such a space as an **independent company** running an **independent service** on the web. If you don't like it, well guess what? **Run your own space!** No one's stopping you.

If Twitter is going to change its rules to make it "OK" to post hate speech on its service, then the people who are targets of that speech along with their allies will pack up and leave…which ironically results in less "free speech" on the platform in totality. "Let everyone express themselves freely in the public square" …and eventually you will find that the only people left in that square are the trolls.

**Good luck with that.**
