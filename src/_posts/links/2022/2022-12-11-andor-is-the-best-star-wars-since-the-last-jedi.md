  Three weeks after its Season One finale, “Andor” feels vital in a way that eluded its predecessors (save for the ubiquity of Baby Yoda, a.k.a Grogu).

  With IP franchises risking streaming fatigue, it’s special that a “Star Wars” property — and a TV series at that — would be beloved by fans and appear on critics’ year-end Top 10 lists (including that of IndieWire’s Ben Travers).

  This success arrives not a moment too soon for “Star Wars,” and offers lessons for the franchise’s future.

OK, so not everyone's going to dig this headline (I don't **hate** _The Last Jedi_ personally, but I don't exactly love it either). That comparison aside, I and I think a lot of the rank and file Star Wars nerds out there have really and truly enjoyed _Andor_. It's certainly one of the best #scifi #tvshows in recent memory, and unlike most of the other Disney SW content, that's almost in spite of _Andor_ being part of the Star Wars franchise.

It's just great storytelling, pure and simple. With adult themes and expert world-building—along with an amazing and awe-inspiring takedown of fascist ideology which speaks poignantly to the present zeitgeist—this is a show that deserves to be taken seriously. There are a few very specific moments in Season 1 which to my mind elevate the entire art form, and it's largely due to top-quality acting (though it's definitely an ensemble cast, Stellan Skarsgård gives a standout performance) and a rock-solid script—NOT some whiz-bang effects and orchestra swells (although it's not entirely devoid of action-adventure-style rousing moments either).

Perhaps _Andor_ won't be to everyone's taste across the broader fandom, but I can tell you right now: THIS is the kind of Star Wars I like. **More please.**
