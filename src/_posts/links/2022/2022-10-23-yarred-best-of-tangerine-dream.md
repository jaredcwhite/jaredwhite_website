  Let me set the stage for what Tangerine Dream has meant to me in my life.
  
  As far as I am concerned, there is music I listen to and enjoy. And then there is Tangerine Dream. They occupy an entire region of my psyche alone. Just like classical music has its Beethoven, a figure who looms larger than life and redefined a whole new era of sound, electronic music has its Tangerine Dream.

Over on the website for my "alter ego" electronic music act _Yarred_, I've started posting every day (until the end of the year!) all about my favorite works by #synthmusic maestros **Tangerine Dream**. [I elaborated a bit about my long-time obsession](https://www.yarred.com/tangerine-dream-2022/10/17/tangram/) with this band on the first installment about the brilliant 1980 album _Tangram_.

I know TD may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you have _any_ interest whatsoever in electronic music, you should be at least familiar with their role in the rise of synthesizers in popular music. As I wrote in the linked article above:

"Talk to any electronic music legend of recent years and ask them what they think about Tangerine Dream. Go ahead. You many not have heard of TD, but I guarantee most of your heroes have."
