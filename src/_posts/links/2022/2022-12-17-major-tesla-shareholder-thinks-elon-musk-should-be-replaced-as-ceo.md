  Leo Koguan is Tesla’s third largest individual shareholder (owner of $3.6bn in stock) and he believes Elon Musk has “abandoned” Tesla. In a recent tweet, Koguan said:

  "Elon abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO. Tesla needs and deserves to have working full time CEO."

While it's _conceivable_ that Elon will soon appoint a new CEO of #Twitter and get back to focusing mostly on Tesla, I wouldn't bet 2c on it. Elon is the ultimate poster child for an unhealthy addiction to social media and reveling in his status as "the main character" — frankly I don't see any indication he's ready to step away from the day-to-day.

If I were a major shareholder of Tesla, I too would be **furious**. Elon's actions are not only damaging to the _business_ of Tesla internally, but to the _reputation_ of the company. Many people, myself included, have switched from viewing Tesla as an aspirational brand to regarding it as anathema. Major structural changes would need to happen at Tesla, including but not limited to firing Elon Musk and bringing on a new CEO, for any of this to turn around.
