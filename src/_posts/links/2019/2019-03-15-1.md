link_title: The Elusive Byzantine Empire
link_excerpt: Though the beginnings of the Byzantine Empire are unclear, its demise
  is not. The history of the Eastern Roman Empire, from its foundation in 324 to its
  conquest in 1453, is one of war, plague, architectural triumphs and fear of God's
  wrath.

Like most Americans I suspect, my general knowledge of Western European history—particularly the British Isles—is far more robust than what little I learned about the East. I knew about Constantinople and the fractured relationship the Byzantine Empire had with the West…first after the initial schism of the Roman Empire, and then at times following the fall of Rome and subsequent rise of the various "barbarian" nation-states in the West. But other than those broad strokes, nothing. This essay by Dionysios Stathakopoulos is a fantastic overview, and it whets my appetite to dive into further study of Byzantine history and culture.
