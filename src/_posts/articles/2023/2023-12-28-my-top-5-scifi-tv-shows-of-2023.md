title: My Top 5 Sci-Fi TV Shows of 2023
subtitle: There was some truly tremendous Sci-Fi in 2023. Unfortunately, little of it was on the silver screen. So this year, let's take a look at the best prestige television which tickled my nerd fancy.

I'm not gonna lie. This was the year I well and truly burnt out on the Comic Book genre in film. I didn't even bother to go see _The Marvels_. I haven't seen _Aquaman 2: The Lost Whatever The Hell It's Called_. I finally saw _The Flash_ after it came out on streaming and regret doing even that.

2023 was _not_ a good year for Sci-Fi nerds when it came to blockbuster movies. There were already signs last year we were in for a dry spell, which is why [my annual blog post covered my top 5 favorite _non_-Sci-Fi films of 2022](/articles/my-top-5-non-scifi-films-of-2022). (I did record a [podcast with my top 10 favorite genre films & TV shows of 2022](/podcast/85/)â€”the two winners of film & TV respectively were _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ and _Severance_â€”with _Star Wars: Andor_ a **very close** runner up).

Thankfully, there was **plenty to love** this year when it came to prestige television. Multiple shows were not only fantastic, but offered standout episodes which transcend the genreâ€¦moments seared into my brain and images I can't wait to revisit.

I had a **really difficult time ranking these**â€”all are outstanding representatives of the creators, studios, and streaming services they appeared on. All of them I would not hesitate to recommend with zero qualifications. These are _must-watch_ shows, bar none. Nevertheless, I did attempt to come up with a rankingâ€”though I do kick things off with a bit of a cheatâ€¦

### 5: Star Trek: Picard (Season 3) & Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (Season 2)

Yeah, I know. I should have picked one of these showsâ€¦but c'mon, they're both **so freaking good!** The final season of _Picard_ was such a departure in tone and storytelling from the previous two, it won back the grumpiest of anti-Nu-Trek fans. Indeed, it was as much a continuation of _The Next Generation_ as it was _Picard_, with nearly all of our beloved crew back for one final mission. Was that what we wanted all along? Maybe!

Also _that_ episode with the huge visual reveal (I won't spoil it): **I TOTALLY LOST IT.** I was screaming, pointing at the TV, jumping up out of my seat, screaming, jumping, pointing, and screaming some more. I will never forget that moment. It was a full-on nerdgasm. ðŸ¤¯ Thank you Terry Matalas for this much-needed catharsis.

And what can I say about _Strange New Worlds_? It continues to be a tremendous accomplishment: a modern Star Trek show which somehow feels like the Star Trek we all know and love, just produced with today's production sensibilities, technology, and binge-friendly character arcs. Can anyone claim that Anson Mount isn't the perfect Captain Pike? He was **born to play this role**, and he knows it.

Please keep making this show forever, m'kay thanks bye!

### 4: Loki (Season 2)

I think it's time to call it. Marvel's MCU on Disney+ era has largely been a very public, very expensive failure. Not only have most of the shows been mediocre (_Secret Invasion_ was so bad, I was legitimately angry after the miniseries finale), but most of the movies made alongside them have also suffered. Instead of getting a proper _Captain Marvel 2_, we got a movie which brought in characters only introduced via multiple Disney+ shows with wildly-varying tones and stylesâ€”thereby diminishing all of them (though I hear the chemistry between the main actresses was pretty good).

But enough about that. We can be grateful we got a smattering of hits out of this whole experiment, and one of them is great indeed: _Loki_. I loved season 1 so much, it garnered an honorable mention in my [Top 5 Sci-Fi Films of 2021](/articles/my-top-5-scifi-films-of-2021) because it truly felt cinematic. I still feel it's the most visually stunning show in all of the MCU on TV, and season 2 most definitely solidified this opinion.

I can pretty much just copy my description of season 1 verbatim:

> Loki was art, man. It was full of production superlatives. The settings were incredible. The music was fantasticâ€”so epic I listened to the soundtrack all on its own. Tom Hiddleston was in peak form. Owen Wilson stole every scene he was in. The ending was mind-bending and unexpected. More shows like this, please Marvel, pretty please!

Did we get more shows like this? ðŸ¤¨ (Alas, no.) And it's likely season 2 was the final season of _Loki_. ðŸ˜­ But what a season! And what an ending! Not only for the show itself, but for the character of Loki across the entire MCUâ€¦a character who has consistently been one of my favorites since the first _Thor_ movie. Again, to continue a theme: **Tom Hiddleston was born to play this role**. And he brings his a-game to this season like never before in a very physical, very theatrical sort of performance which is exactly what you would expect from the God of Mischief. Also a fun bonus: casting Ke Huay Quan in this season was a stroke of genius. His contribution to the story is both hilarious and heartwarming, which is exactly what you'd expect from the Academy Award-winning star of _Everything Everywhere All at Once_.

### 3: Silo

Truth be told, I hate this ranking. I wish _Silo_ could shoot to #2 or even #1 because it's just so, so good. (Apple TV+ continues to knock it out of the park with quality show after quality showâ€¦is this the official home for overall best Sci-Fi on television today?) Regrettably, since the next two shows are so high-quality and epic, it means I must relegate _Silo_ to third place.

But this is in no way a reflection on the merits of this show! FWIW, my kids consider this on par with _Severance_ and _Loki_ and had a blast watching it with me. The mysteries are expertly done, the acting is top drawer (seriously, how can you go wrong with Rebecca Ferguson?), the production design of the silo location itself is mesmerizing, and the slow burn of the plot leading up to a grand reveal in the season finale leaves one aching for the next season. (Thankfully, we know Apple's given it the green light!)

Just basking in the knowledge that both _Silo_ and _Severance_ will be returning means Apple TV+ is a **powerhouse** of a streaming service for nerds heading into 2024â€”but wait, there's more!

### 2: The Last of Us

Before we pull on that thread, let's talk about one of the most highly-anticipated shows of 2023: _The Last of Us_. I never played the original games, but I did play the first three _Uncharted_ games on PS3 so I know just how good Naughty Dog games can be. Thus I of course was intrigued about the show and hoped it would do the games justice, but otherwise I wasn't quite sure what to expect.

**Oh. My. God!**

I think it's safe to say they fucking nailed it. ðŸ™Œ

The chemistry between Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey as Ellie is simply off the charts. Now we've seen this apparent trope many times before: a precocious girl gets taken under the wing of a battle-hardened dude and is protected from the many dangerous of a cruel worldâ€¦where slowly an unbreakable bond is forged between the two.

Thankfully, this show is much smarter than that (and perhaps that's due to the quality of the source material). Ellie is no ordinary damsel-in-distress, and Joel is no ordinary warrior with a heart of gold. Their relationship is complex and messy and at times even disturbing. Both characters have been fucked up pretty good due to the horrific world they're forced to navigate, and one can hardly blame them for barely holding onto their humanity as the narrative progresses.

But perhaps what is most impressive about this show goes beyond the central story and even the world-building surrounding it. I'm talking about _that_ episode, the one that got everyone buzzing: _Long, Long Time_. Talk about transcending a genreâ€”not only did this episode deviate from the source material in some key ways that actually made the story so much better, but it broke entirely out of the mold of "post-apocalyptic hellscape" and portrayed a vision of love and devotion against all odds which honestly I'm not sure I've ever seen on TV (and rarely in the greatest of films). If this episodeâ€”and the creators who made it happenâ€”doesn't win every damn award available for 2023, then some people are just screwy.

I'm afraid I can't give this show my coveted #1 spot simply because I'm not sure I would ever care to watch it again (other than that one episode). It's _heavy_ and gut-wrenching and terrifying. I'm not super into horror, and this is as much horror as it is Sci-Fi. But is it exquisitely crafted and worth the watch at least once? _Absolutely._

### 1: Foundation (Season 2)

**Tada! Apple TV+ strikes again.**

So the first season of Foundation was one of two major adaptations of classic novels which came out in 2021, the other being _Dune: Part One_. I really loved _Dune_ and it appeared in my #2 spot of [best Sci-Fi films of 2021](/articles/my-top-5-scifi-films-of-2021). I also really loved _Foundation_ and the similarly epic and expansive feel it had. However, due to the wide-ranging storytelling set across multiple eras, as well as the wide variety of settings, characters, and plot threads, I wasn't quite sure if season 1 of _Foundation_ could carry its impressive momentum into another quality season, or if it was in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own ambition and perhaps taking itself a wee bit too seriously.

**I shouldn't have worried.**

_Foundation_ season 2 is incredible, upping the ante in every way. Setting aside _Star Wars: Andor_, I have no hesitation in saying that **this** is the kind of epic space opera Sci-Fi I'm looking for and have sorely missed from that franchise. Whereas the Disney+ Star Wars shows have largely felt like decent actors cosplaying on fancy LED stages, _Foundation_ feels like grand storytelling on a galactic scale. Real stakes. Real planets. A real empire with very formidable power to give life or to take it. Jaw-dropping events spanning generations which all connect to each other in surprising and even mystical ways.

Sometimes _Foundation_ reminds me of _The Expanse_ and the sort of realism it was able to portray even in the milieu of futuristic locales. Other times _Foundation_ reminds me of the kind of mind-bending sense of scale you see in a movie like _Dune_. If you're looking for cinematic TV, you'll get it with this series. Every episode looks like a million bucks (and knowing Apple, that's probably true).

And let's be clear: while every actor in this series does a fabulous job, Lee Pace steals the show in every scene he's in. When you're supposed to portray a god-like emperor who commands the allegiance of planets near and far, you can either play up the camp and make it all seem rather ridiculousâ€¦or you can, well, portray a true god-like emperorâ€”a role which in lesser hands would be very difficult to pull off.

Lee Pace does just that, and to top it all off, there's a scene completely centered on him in one of the later episodes which is yet again a genre-transcending moment. It's awesome and awful and chilling and thrillingâ€”and a hell of a way to end that particular episode.

With all of the other shows and roles up for contention in awards season, I don't know if Lee Pace will win many awards for his role in season 2 of _Foundation_, but he absolutely deserves them. Of course I shouldn't ignore all the other tremendous acting we get in this season. I'll just go down the list: Jared Harris, Lou Llobell, Leah Harvey, Laura Birn, Cassian Bilton, Terrence Mannâ€¦and on and on. A special shoutout to Ben Daniels who is also an absolute scene-stealer, as well as Ella-Rae Smith who somehow manages to play the role of a young queen in a manner both tender and formidable.

Honestly, I can't think of a single episode, character, plot point I had any qualms with. I was riveted every momentâ€”and I can't wait to rewatch this show again and again. Might we dare to hope that season 3 will be as good as the first two?

**I do! Bring it on.**

----

All right folks, it's time to touch on a few misses and an honorable mention or two.

As mentioned previously, I **hated** _Secret Invasion_â€¦which really sucks because I was so looking forward to seeing Samuel L. Jackson reprise his iconic role as Nick Fury as well as immerse myself in the paranoid espionage thriller vibes we were expecting. Yikes. I have no idea what happened during the production of this show, but it was baaaadâ€¦

I was also disappointed with both _The Mandalorian_ season 3 and _Star Wars: Ahsoka_. Neither show was all that bad per seâ€¦but they also weren't terribly good either. Both suffered from a sort of inward navel-gazing which seems to increasingly plague Star Wars in the Disney+ era. Almost every episode feels like it's beating you over the head with lore, and you MUST really be digging all this lore as a die-hard Star Wars fan, right? RIGHT??!!

I fear the recent elevation of Dave Filoni to czar of Star Wars canon may eventually prove as much of a curse as it is a blessing. Will it be better than the wild-west plot nonsense of the sequel trilogy? Most certainly. Will it lead to more standout, genre-transcending productions such as _Star Wars: Andor_? Honestly, I'm not sure. And that scares me.

**But let's end on a positive note.**

Now this isn't actually a TV show, but it's a made-for-Netflix movie which I was actually quite surprised and delighted by so I'll throw it a bone: _Leave the World Behind_.

This is sort of the movie I wish _Knock at the Cabin_ had been. Produced, directed, and co-written by Sam Esmail (of _Mr. Robot_ fame), it is a story about a family who is increasingly isolated from the outside world as bit-by-bit everything seems to fall apart. (And by "everything" do I mean civilization-asâ€“weâ€“knowâ€“it, or one's basic grasp at humanity and fellowship with your fellow citizens? Interesting question!)

I've heard that not everyone is on board with the ending of this movie, but I loved it. As a fan of absurdist dark comedy, it definitely worked for me. And all throughout the movie, the slow ramp up of tension due to the cinematography, editing, and musical score was exactly what I would hope to experience watching a movie like this. Good job Netflix! (Their cinematic output has definitely been hit-or-miss for some time now, so it's great to see this one round out the year.)

And finally, I'll give a shoutout to season 4 of _For All Mankind_ (yet another Apple TV+ show!). It's not finished yet, so I can't say how I'll like the season finale. But once again, this series offers workmanlike quality every episode. It's a real ensemble cast, and nobody is ever as "good" or as "bad" as you expect them to be. It's people making decisionsâ€”sometimes stupid onesâ€”in situations where their actions might mean the life or death of their comrades. In that respect, _For All Mankind_ is a very grounded showâ€¦which is ironic when you consider much of it takes place in space or on the surface of Mars.

So there you have it. My Top 5 Sci-Fi TV Shows of 2023, and a couple of honorable mentions. **What were your favorite shows of the year? Let me know in the fediverse comments!**
