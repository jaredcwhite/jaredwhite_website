It has been quite the while since I last wrote about my experiences with mindfulness meditation. I touched on it in [_What Synchronicity Means to Me in Everyday Life_](https://jaredwhite.com/articles/what-synchronicity-means-to-me#the-skill-of-mindful-observation), saying:

> Learning the skill of mindful observation and how it can transform the neural wiring of our brains truly changed my life. It’s a skill you can apply at any time to gain deeper access to your inner life.

But to the uninitiated, what does this really look like? What does it _feel_ like? Well, that's where **Barbie** comes in.

### Moving Past the "Hippie" Stereotype

It's long bothered me that anything "hippie" or "new age" is often the butt of jokes in popular culture (namely movies and TV). Now listen: I'm totally willing to concede there's a volume of snake oil and grifting and obvious nonsense being peddled out there. For whatever reason, anything related to the "spiritual" or "supernatural" seems to attract bad actors preying upon the weak-minded and looking to make a fast buck. (Probably because these are areas of subjective truth, not objective, so it's nearly impossible to prove anyone "wrong". You have to _be a skeptic_ already in order to remain skeptical.)

But just as cynical jerks (or fanatics) who pervert religion don't make religion inherently bad (skeptics, please don't email me), jerks who pervert meditation don't make meditation inherently bad either. If you think the lengthy silent retreats and the candles and the pillows and the Buddha statues and all that is "weird", I'm not here to argue with you.

**But I will happily state with confidence that meditation has changed my life.** And in particular, the category labeled [mindfulness meditation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356) which the Mayo Clinic describes thusly:

> Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.

I have often wished people who aren't familiar with mindfulness or who have written it off as just more hokum could gain a better idea of what it actually is, and how it is actually beneficial.

And nowhere have I seen this better depicted on-screen than in the 2023 film _Barbie_, as played by Margot Robbie and directed by Greta Gerwig.

**Warning: minor spoilers ahead! If you haven't yet seen Barbie, you may want to come back to this!**

### The Bench Scene

For reference, [here's a YouTube video of the scene I'm about to describe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=K-xHvro7rRI). I apologize the clip is very dim (not sure why, the picture is supposed to be much brighter).

Shortly after arriving in The Real World, Barbie is quick to notice things here aren't quite as she had imagined it. After a series of fish-out-of-water mishaps, she finally sends Ken packing for a few minutes, sits down on a park bench, closes her eyes, and tried to connect with the "owner" of the doll which has been adversely affecting her.

Before long, Barbie is successful in reaching out with her mind and gets to witness a series of flashbacks of the owner's life and experiences around childhood and play. It's a poignant moment, especially as further scenes of growth and very human struggles show a less-than-idylic scenario.

Barbie slowly opens her eyes, only to realize she is shedding a tear. What is this strange sensation? "That felt achy…but good."

**If the scene had simply ended here, it would have been a good one.** We get to see Barbie start to grapple with real human emotion and the vast expanse of human experience both good and bad. A helpful stepping stone on her journey through the course the film.

_But wait, there's more!_

Now with **eyes open**, Barbie starts to look around. She sees families playing in a park. Children with bicycles. There's a couple arguing, not connecting. Confused. Then she starts to glance up at the trees overlooking the park. She sees the slight movement of the branches, hears the wind blowing through them. Birdsong. Then she notices a couple of men bonding over something amusing. And then another man, alone, appearing like the weight of the world is on his shoulders.

Barbie is reacting a bit in the moment to each of these real-life dioramas, but mostly she is simply witnessing. Observing. _Feeling but not judging._

### You're So Beautiful

This scene—already an outlier in the mile-a-minute sensory overload that is modern cinema—culminates in Margot Robbie's character glancing over to the other end of the bench where an old woman calmly sits. The newly-enlightened Barbie closely observes the woman, and after a long pause of them exchanging soft glances, remarks with quiet amazement "You're so beautiful."

Now at this point, your instinct as the audience member is to assume the response will be "why, thank you dear!" or "gosh, you're beautiful too." But instead our expectations are subverted, and we are given something far more profound and meaningful to the entire story of the film. The old woman proudly states:

"I know it!"

And then they laugh.

You see, the old woman already understands her beauty. Her worth. She has accepted her unique contribution to the world, as well as her role as interconnected within this world. Life itself is beautiful, yet fleeting, and this woman—who is indeed nearing the end of her life—is already at peace, having pierced the veil of individual ego and experienced a glimpse of the oneness of all things.

If there's any other scene in modern cinema which so captures the journey of mindfulness meditation and its role in helping us attain some semblance of what might be deemed "enlightenment", I'm not aware of it. This pivotal moment in the film when Barbie is able to gaze upon an old woman who is by no conventional beauty standards "beautiful" and call her **beautiful** _could only have happened_ after Barbie is able to raise her experiential awareness through mindfulness meditation. The meditation on the bench and the exchange with the old woman aren't two separate events. _They're the same event._ Barbie tunes out the noise in her head, moves past her fears, moves past even her immediate goals (find the girl, figure out what's wrong with me), and simply begins to **observe**.

She observes her own emotional state.

She observes people in her environment having experiences of their own.

She observes the natural order around her: the trees rustling in the breeze, and the birds for whom the trees are a home.

She observes how everyone at first seems like their stories are differentiated and unique, but upon further observation the natural world and the experiences of humans everywhere are in a certain sense _universal_. We are all connected. We are all part of something bigger. _We are all one._

**This is the enlightenment of mindfulness meditation.** Barbie was able to move beyond the rigid artificiality of her plastic world—though it had once seemed to be the epitome of joy and perfection—and furthermore she was even able to move beyond the temporary pressures of her own anxiety and inner turmoil and the immediate "why" she was there. Suddenly she wasn't sitting on that park bench merely to "do something" (find a girl, figure out what's wrong with Barbie, fix the situation, and go back to how things were). She was there _because she was there_. And that's good enough. It is always good enough.

**I am beautiful. You are beautiful. Life is beautiful.**

_I know it. You know it._

### Further Analysis

As incredible as this scene is (I've cried literally every single time I've watched it. I'm wiping back a tear even as I type this!), I do want to acknowledge that Barbie as a film overall exhibits some problems around intersectional social justice and concerns beyond the simplistic dichotomy of men vs. women and their ongoing power struggle. The irony of Barbie being angrily labeled "woke" by the anti-woke establishment is that it actually isn't woke enough in many respects. For an incredible deep dive analysis on the topic, [check out this video essay by Jessie Gender](https://www.patreon.com/posts/93296344) (currently Patreon-only, but perhaps there will be a version up on [Jessie's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JessieGender1) soon). Jessie's comparison of the structure and resolution of Barbie vs. The Matrix films was particularly clever and insightful. (And I'm _always_ a sucker for any mention of my favorite movie of all time…)

Despite all that, I enjoyed Barbie tremendously—in no small part due to the mindfulness meditation scene alone. It's wild to discover after the fact that [this scene was almost cut short](https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/greta-gerwig-almost-cut-barbie-movie-scene-ann-roth-margot-robbie). As Greta Gerwig so aptly put it: "If I cut the scene, I don’t know what this movie is about." Truly, this scene _made_ the movie.

My daughter enjoyed the movie as well, but much to my chagrin she thinks all this mindfulness stuff I always talk about is loopy. (Maybe some kids just aren't ready for it yet…) She definitely enjoyed telling me about all the old Barbie references peppered throughout the movie that somehow she knows about even though she herself never played with Barbies much and doesn't really like them anyway! (Yay for the YouTube algorithm, I guess?)

At any rate, I hope you yourself are intrigued by this amazing onscreen depiction of what mindfulness meditation can be like in The Real World, and that you're motivated to dig a little deeper if you don't yet practice mindfulness regularly. I know there is plenty of annoying mumbo jumbo out there surrounding meditation, and you may feel like you're not even sure where to begin.

**Maybe take a page from Barbie!** Sit on a park bench, close your eyes, and simply _be_. Then a moment or two later, open your eyes and simply observe the world around you, as well as the sensations within your own body. You don't need to overthink it (in fact please don't!), and you don't need to start trying to figure out what it all means. The key to successful meditation is to become _nonjudgmental_. If you feel happy, you're happy. If you feel sad, you're sad. If you feel confused, you're confused. If you feel elated, you're elated.

That's it. And that's all it needs to be. After all, are you a human doing? Or a human being?

(Sorry, that was corny. Too corny? Too corny. Whoops, now who's being judgmental?! 😬😅)
