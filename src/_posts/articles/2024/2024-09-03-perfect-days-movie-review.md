Without a doubt I knew I would love this movie. (Hat tip to Thomas Flight's amazing video essay [Hollywood's Obsession with Ambition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BucSbzYXqKM) which highlights this film as an example of the kind of story you rarely see told in mainstream cinema.)

At first glance, you might approach _Perfect Days_ expecting it to be a quaint little film about a simple man (of meager status in society) going about his simple day, and then all of a sudden something happens to puncture his comfortable routine and make him question the nature of his poor existence. And while there _is_ an element of that trope to be found here, I genuinely don't think that's the point of the movie—certainly not its central theme.

Instead, what I think _Perfect Days_ is about is this (and it's all but stated clearly by the protagonist, Hirayama, in an incredibly insightful conversation):

**There are many worlds within our world**, and the world in which the most celebrated among us are those who are gentle of spirit, quiet yet understanding, quickened with wisdom yet slow to teach, observant of small details, careful to do good work regardless of its appreciation by others, able to find worthwhile meaning and creative merit even in the mundane…is not a world in sync with much of modern culture & civilization.

Society celebrates the high earners, the outwardly "successful", the movers & shakers who can make a splash, make a scene, make an obvious "dent" in the universe. Perhaps in certain cases, such lauding of lofty outcomes is indeed warranted. But I would argue—and it seems this film does argue—that finding fulfillment in the trappings of cosmopolitan relevance is certainly not a universal path…and rewarding alternatives are routinely overlooked.

### Two roads diverged, and Hirayama took the one less traveled by…

(_Minor spoilers ahead._)

It's not spelled out in detail what occurred in the past, but it seems Hirayama's family had been well-to-do, yet he walked away under less-than-ideal circumstances—while his sister remained "in the fold". Was their father abusive? Or simply overbearing and demanding? Perhaps the family business was repugnant to Hirayama in some way? Whatever caused the rift, Hirayama became estranged and went off to forge his own destiny.

A destiny, that is, revolving around **cleaning some of Tokyo's finest toilets**, taking pictures of trees, listening to cassette tapes of Van Morrison, and reading books for "intellectuals" before nodding off to sleep in his modest apartment.

Now I realize that makes him sound quite "boring" and not at all worthy of being the star attraction of a motion picture, but hear me out. There's more to Hirayama than what he does, and that's kind of the point.

He may be _invisible_ to most others in society, yet the people who have taken the trouble to get to know him admire him. They recognize that he is a considerate person. A safe person. A _good_ person. He works hard and gets the job done right. He's dependable. He has been through some stuff, certainly, but that didn't result in his becoming callous, cynical, or self-absorbed. He may not be a "gentleman", but he's a **gentle man**.

And it turns out these qualities are particularly important to the women who turn to Hirayama when shit happens in their lives.

Aya—who feels pressured by her boyfriend to take things to the next level and she's clearly not willing to go there. Yet she enjoys listening to Hirayama's music collection and plants a demure kiss on his cheek. **He's safe, and she knows it**.

Niko—the teenage niece he barely recognizes at first who turns towards him without hesitation as part of her first-ever "runaway" adventure. (Apparently things are not going well in the household of Hirayama's sister…echoes of the past?) Far from seeming fazed by her uncle's simple existence as a toilet cleaner or his unfamiliar ancient technology (what's a cassette tape?!), she relishes it. To her, he seems more grounded, more reassuring, and more in-tune with some sort of inner peace she longs to cultivate. Outwardly he doesn't own much besides books, tapes, and plants, but spiritually **he is rich…while her own family is in essence poor**.

And "Mama"—the bar owner Hirayama is on friendly terms with…and perhaps in time, more. Although she'll deny it with loud protestations, apparently he gets a bit more to drink and a bit more to eat than the other patrons of her establishment. And even though he appears to be nothing more than a friendly regular customer, Mama's ex-husband who is dying of cancer is somehow able to pick up on the fact that of anyone in the world he could implore to "take care of Mama for me", **it's Hirayama**. (Even though it's "not like that". Yeah Hirayama, sure. Right…)

In an era where the chronically online chatter over whether, as a woman, it's safer to hang out with a man or a bear—in an era when "incel" culture has truly become a menace to our political discourse—in an era when young men may find themselves falling down that rabbit hole of wondering what their place is in a world where women gain equality of status, means, and purpose—a genuinely _decent_ older man as depicted in the person of Hirayama doesn't just warm the heart…it demonstrates that a human who operates from the vantage point of mindfulness, dedication, and true cultivation of spirit isn't just a figment of a bygone age but a _blueprint we are in desperate need of_.

The overflowing of memes around Tim Walz and his "big dad energy" is simply another variation on this theme: we can all stop pretending we don't know what "tonic masculinity" (I love this phrase!) looks like, because we do.

**It looks, in a certain way, like Hirayama.**

I don't believe this means we should all quit our high-paying corporate jobs and become toilet cleaners to find the path to ultimate fulfillment. That's not what _Perfect Days_ is saying.

It's saying, I believe, that the strength of character needed to perform the best work you can, to care deeply about the welfare of others, to admire the beauty of Mother Earth, and to stay in tune with your hidden self—finding that is true nobility. And making the intention to cultivate that wisdom path is a most worthy goal, whether or not you happen to clean toilets or run for political office or write code or volunteer at the local non-profit or fly to the moon.

### Finding joy amidst the banality

Hirayama isn't "happy" thoughout the whole film. In fact, he really ends up struggling due to some of the things which happen to him and finds it very difficult to regain his composure. And I was deeply moved by the final scene of the film—I won't give it away, but let's just say it's a _tour de force_ of subtle emotive acting.

And that too is the point of _Perfect Days_. Mindfulness exercise and spiritual "enlightenment" (however you might chose to define that) isn't a magic bullet. **Sometimes life just sucks**, plain and simple. Inevitably you'll have bad days. Everything will leave a sour taste in your mouth.

But those days do pass. The sun will rise as it always does. And if you take the time to stop and notice, you'll find the beauty again even in the mundane. **You'll recognize the priceless value of a gentle spirit**. And you'll revel in that indescribable feeling of _komorebi_ once again.

_Perfect Days_ was written by German film veteran Wim Wenders along with Takuma Takasaki. It stars acclaimed Japanese actor Kōji Yakusho as Hirayam and was directed by Wenders. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 2023 and is currently streaming on Hulu. Wenders was initially approached to create a documentary about the architectural significance of Tokyo's public toilets and instead crafted an intimate character study about "finding joy in our everyday banality" ([MovieWeb](https://movieweb.com/wim-wenders-takuma-takasaki-perfect-days-interview/)).
