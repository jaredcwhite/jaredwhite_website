Let it be known I'm not a nostalgic person by and large. I tend to appreciate "old and new" in equal measure‚Äîin fact, a trend-line I've seen in my life across a variety of pursuits and talents is a concept I once termed _ancient-future_. I believe most innovation happens at the cross section of re-discovering ideas and styles which fell out of favor or were largely forgotten long ago and bringing them into the present day with an attractively fresh spin.

So keep that in mind as you continue reading, because this isn't a WWSJD (What Would Steve Jobs Do) puff piece or a "gosh, computers used to be fun" kvetch sesh. We have work to do.

### Beating Out the Condor

Like most famous people in tech, Steve Jobs had a lot to say. Unlike most famous people in tech, he usually said it very well. And [one of my favorite nuggets in the canon of Jobs](https://youtu.be/6kalMB8jDnY?si=RiyIlRUNSa5Z_s0h&t=209) is this oft-cited analogy:

> ‚ÄúI think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we‚Äôre tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn‚Äôt look so good. But then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away‚Äîcompletely off the top of the charts.
> 
> ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it‚Äôs the most remarkable tool that we‚Äôve ever come up with, and it‚Äôs the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.‚Äù

_Bicycle for our minds._ I love this phrase, **love it**. I've thought about it a lot over the years. And I think in this particular moment we find ourselves in, as we see Big Tech lurch from one questionable Next Big Thing‚Ñ¢ to another, our ability to truly grasp the significance of this analogy has never been more necessary.

I realize the Steve Jobs' "bicycle for the mind" concept flows from that particular study he referenced‚Ä¶perhaps he could have used another type of locomotion had he found a different source as the hook for his oration. But in my view, the bicycle offers a _very particular lens_ through which to understand the significance of this analogy.

As Jobs illustrates, humans purely on their own power are less efficient than a number of other creatures, with the condor rising to the top. Yes, we're good at distance running, but we can only run so far, so fast. We reach a limit, and like any other creature, we must accept our limitations.

**Except that we don't.** Through the eons of evolution which produced the human mind, and through the centuries of the human mind producing tools ever more novel and capable, we arrived at an impressive _augmentation_ which answers this question: what if humans were born with wheels instead of legs? That's essentially what a bicycle is. Wheels that transmit power from the pumping of our two legs to a rolling motion which swiftly propels us forward. The genius of this invention lies in its conceptual simplicity:

* It doesn't require **extra fuel**.
* It doesn't require **exotic materials** (unless you consider metal, plastic, and rubber exotic).
* It doesn't come with troubling environmental downsides (at least relative to any alternatives).
* It's approachable to nearly everyone.
* While less safe than walking/running, **it's much safer** than nearly any other form of personal transportation.

And so a human‚Äîaugmented with wheels (aka a bicycle)‚Äîis suddenly far more efficient than any other creature, and can go _farther, faster_ than is afforded by biology alone.

### "Airplane for the Mind?" ‚Ä¶just say no!

Alas, it's time for us to stretch this analogy to its breaking point‚Äîand for good reason!

The significance of Jobs describing computers as "bicycles for the mind" and not "automobiles for the mind" or "airplanes for the mind" cannot be overstated. When looking at the history of technological development, we tend to _flatten_ out the relationships between new inventions and view everything on a linear timeline. In this depiction, first humans simply ran, then we had horses/camels/elephants/etc., then we had bicycles, then we had trains, then we had cars, then we had planes‚Äîeach method of locomotion "better" than the last.

Except that timeline is thoroughly incorrect, wrong-headed, and actually _dangerous_ for any legitimate conversation around urban planning, safety, and protecting the health of our planet.

Airplanes do seem very cool and futuristic‚Äîexcept that in the vast majority of cases, people would be better served traveling by high-speed rail rather than by plane‚Ä¶a fact that unfortunately is biting my country (the United States) in the ass right now because we're _woefully_ behind in our rollout of modern rail systems as compared to most other developed nations.

And as every urbanist on YouTube is shouting from the rooftops at this point: using a combination of public transportation and micromobiles (aka bicycles/e-bikes/scooters/etc.) is vastly superior for the vast majority of inter-urban travel than owning and driving a large motor vehicle. In other words, hashtag **FuckCars**.

This is why I often roll my eyes when people use cars‚Äîand they really do, no joke!‚Äîas a _positive_ example of technological progress as their point of reference in discussions around emerging technologies like AI, VR, Crypto, etc. "Yes, it's true that cars can be dangerous, bad for the environment, expensive, and socially isolating‚Äîbut look at all the good they can do!" In other words, we accept all of the "bad" of automobiles in society because of all the "benefits" they provide.

**I hate to break it to ya, but many societies around the world are dramatically rethinking this calculus.**

Maybe cars are actually just‚Ä¶y'know‚Ä¶bad. üòÖ

(Obviously for a variety of specific use cases, cars are certainly the correct approach. Thankfully, there's a ready solution here: rent a car/truck/van _only when you need it!_)

And so much of this reimagining is happening regarding air travel as well. Increasingly regions around the world are connecting (or have done so already!) their major metro areas with high-speed rail, largely alleviating the need for short flights altogether. There are a variety of benefits to this, not the least of which is air travel (through the use of jet fuel) is incredibly damaging to the environment!

**What if‚Äîand please hear me out‚Äîthey actually got it mostly right ~100 years ago? Bicycles + trains are the futuristic transportation technology we actually need.**

I'll also add another layer of the analogy here. In an "airplane for the mind" scenario, computer technology is entirely passive and thoroughly captive. It may be a "fun experience", but you have no control over it and you can't leave. You're entirely at the mercy of the operators of the aircraft.

Doesn't that sound a lot like the description of AI? Or of VR? Increasingly, we find ourselves being sold tools which aren't simply "augmentations" of the capabilities we already have, integrated into the real-world environments and habits and social connections we actually engage with, but are total worlds unto themselves. More and more, we find ourselves *captive* to our tools, rather than *liberated* by them. And more and more, we are at the mercy of the platform operators. Our experiences are defined by what Microsoft or OpenAI or‚Äîand this is what pains me most of all‚ÄîApple dictates is permissible.

**Quick tangent:** in a true "bicycle for the mind" flavor of the iPad, it would provide an operating system as flexible, extensible, and un-locked-down as macOS or Linux. What we have now is rather a Frankensteinian hybrid: a device which _appears_ to offer a diverse set of experiences under the full control of the user, while in reality offering only that subset of operational range deemed acceptable by its corporate originator. That's not true freedom, but only a poor imitation thereof and _certainly_ not "the future of computing". (Which makes me very sad because I firmly believe the tablet form-factor _is_.)

### Value Augmentation, not Substitution

Rounding out our discussion of this analogy, the tremendous value of early computing lay in its ability to _augment_ our innate capabilities. Like bicycles do for our bodies, computers can help our minds go farther, faster, more efficiently. People talk about their computer knowledge bases serving as a "second brain", and people use internet technology to share their creations and discoveries and fluidly converse with other humans all over the world.

But somewhere along the way, Silicon Valley stumbled. They forgot that the value of computer & internet technology rests in _augmentation_, and they began to think of their inventions as _substitutions_.

Despite all of Apple's claims to the contrary, the Vision Pro "substitutes" a carefully-curated digital environment (entirely at the mercy of Apple) in place of a real one‚Äîmessy and chaotic though it may be.

Copilot-style chatbots substitute a clever party-trick approximation of human intelligence in place of actual intelligence and the value of real, hard-won expertise.

NFTs & Crypto substitutes a false sense of ownership, value storage, and safe transactions in place of true ownership and trust in transactions.

So much of what I see getting pumped out of Silicon Valley these days feels like the equivalent of "airplanes for the mind" or "automobiles for the mind"‚Äîand nothing is so on the nose here as the failed promise of "self-driving cars" peddled by the likes of Tesla‚Äîand very little feels philosophically consistent with Jobs' "bicycles for the mind" analogy.

Perhaps we need more urbanists, sociologists, and other learned scholars of the humanities placed in positions of power. When you listen to the key players in today's Big Tech ramble on about what they think is the future of humanity, the level of understanding and self-awareness they seem to exhibit around humanist subjects is _frighteningly poor_. When Sam Altman posts "her" on X and they show off a creepy flirt-bot helping a tech bro learn how to breathe, this total disconnect between technological influence and cultural cognizance is on full display.

**Here's how to cut the crap:**

Whether it's Apple, Google, OpenAI, or any other Big Tech company or VC-fueled startup promoting what _they_ have decided we should consider groundbreaking and revolutionary, ask yourself the following questions:

* Does this technology augment the work I (and people I respect) already enjoy doing? Or does this try to substitute the work that I appreciate myself and others doing?
* Does this technology keep me grounded in the real-world culture around me, connecting me more deeply and meaningfully with fellow humans in the urban fabric? Or does it further isolate me and keep me hooked‚Äîopium-like‚Äîon poor approximations of social engagement?
* Does this technology offer total freedom to pursue how I choose to utilize (or not) the given technology so as to benefit my lifestyle and my core values? Or do I increasingly find myself beholden to the technology, trapped in a cycle of "enshittification" which offers little chance of escape?
* Does this technology prioritize genuine human creativity, "analog" experiences I can enjoy apart from the digital overlay, true expertise & experience, and that "special sauce" which emerges from friction-free human-to-human interactions? Or does the technology downplay expertise & experience and instead attempt to foster a poorly-validated, algorithm-centric view into creativity, productivity, and communication?

In other words, we must **value augmentation, not substitution**. Never have we needed to understand deeply the importance of the "bicycle for the mind" analogy as we do right now‚Äîand why specifically that analogy holds up _because_ bicycles are the point of reference and not some other form of locomotion.

I don't know what Steve Jobs would do if he were alive today, and it's pointless to speculate. But I know what _I would do_, having appreciated so much about Jobs' philosophy and vision for the future of computing. As he stated, the computer is a tool‚Äîa remarkable tool, but a tool nonetheless. And like any tool, _we_ get to decide when, where, why, and how we prefer to use it. **Not the tech bros. Us.**
