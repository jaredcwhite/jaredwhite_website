A few months ago, as I was searching for some new reading material on "tonic masculinity" as opposed to the toxic variety, I came across the book _Man Enough_ by Justin Baldoni.

Now I knew absolutely nothing about Baldoni. I'd never listened to his podcast, watched his TED talk, or seen any of his movie or TV appearances. (I was so out of the loop, I hadn't even connected the dots between him and _It Ends with Us_â€¦a film I might add I still haven't seen.) But the description sounded interesting, and he seemed like the artsy hipster type. Right up my alley. So I bought the book from my local bookstore ([Powell's](https://www.powells.com), of course) and went into it with a completely open mind.

**Oh I made a big mistake!**

First off, pretty soon after getting started on the Preface and the Introduction and then Chapter 1, I found myself rather put off by the bland writing. More than blandâ€”I just don't think this book is well-written. Maybe it gets better later on? I must admit, I fizzled out before I could find out.

I also didn't find myself relating much to stories whichâ€”while I don't doubt happenedâ€”sound utterly clichÃ©. Like being taunted by bullies to jump off a bridge into freezing cold water when he was thirteen, and if he didn't he's a "pussy". Isn't this every melodramatic coming-of-age boy story ever?

It's a bummer he didn't tell them to go pound sand and skedaddle on out of there. But maybe I need to read the rest of the book to learn what that was all about. Also it's probably on me that, since I was homeschooled my entire childhood until graduating from high school (jazz hands on that last bit), I never dealt with idiot teenagers on cold bridges. I _did_ deal with idiot teenagers online, because I was _very online_ pretty much from the moment you could be. But that's a different tale.

### And Then, The Controversy

With me feeling bored and disappointed that yet another attempt to "grapple with my manhood" had landed with a thud, I moved onto to other more immediate matters.

_Wham!_ December 20, 2024: [Blake Lively has filed a sexual harassment complaint against Justin Baldoni](https://www.today.com/popculture/movies/blake-lively-complaint-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-rcna185107).

**What. The. Actual. Fuck.**

Since that bombshell, there's been a frenzy of activity. Baldoni got dropped by his talent agency, awards have been rescinded (because I guess Baldoni isn't a feminist after all), and now he's being sued _by his own former publicist_.

The author of the book _It Ends with Us_, Colleen Hoover, is publicly standing by Blake Lively, and other cast members are as well. And if you read Lively's complaint, part of the shocking allegations are that Justin Baldoni wasn't just acting like a creep on set, but he then attempted to get his PR folks to launch a smear campaign to discredit Lively and "ruin her reputation before the film was released".

Gee, sounds like a swell guy.

Now of course everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and until this gets adjudicated in a court of law, all we have are bits and pieces of evidence (such as text messages) and people's perspectives on what happened during those events. But that won't stop most people from "taking sides"â€”you could say this is the new "Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard". Hollywood is no stranger to salacious scandals!

But now back to me.

### This is Why We Can't Have Nice Things

I don't find it coincidental in the slightest that the _one_ book I bought since I was in the throes of 2000s-era patriarchal evangelicalism that was _specifically_ about "manhood" just so happens to be authored by a dude who is now engulfed in controversy and being canceled.

Because here's the honest truth:

**I have been failed by every single male role model in my life.**\*

\* (I _am_ on good terms with my father these days, but only after many years of hard work getting past painful differences and, at times, estrangement.)

Pastors have let me down. Almost every single one I ever followed back in my religious days ended up falling from grace and was found guilty of all sorts of heinous sins.

Local business leaders have let me down.

Politicians have let me down.

Programmers have let me down. ([why? WHY??](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/future/road-to-bridgetown-2.0-escaping-burnout/))

Virtually every CEO of every major tech company has let me down spectacularly. (And to think I once admired Satya Nadella. How naÃ¯ve I was!)

It's not a question of who in particular has ended up on the _Epic Fail!_ list. **It's who hasn't.** And I would have to think long and hard about that list because, wow, it's tiny.

Now it's certainly true I've had many friends over the years both online and offline of various gender expressions who I deeply respect and appreciate. But the trick is, none of these people are in **positions of power** as you and I would understand it. I still don't fully grasp the reasons why, but **it really does seem that men (white men at least!) are almost universally unable to handle the slightest whiff of unaccountable authority**. And the sad truth is, those scenarios are the norm, not the outlier.

ðŸš¨ **Mediocre white men.** ðŸš¨

Spare us, please.

I realize, as a white man, I have to put in significant work to recognize when I'm being insensitive, when I'm taking up all the "space" in a dialogue without realizing it, when I'm expecting people to simply believe my expertise without proving it first. It's been a process over the years to "check my privilege" and I know I'll keep screwing up from time to time.

What truly, utterly enrages me is when the "manosphere" just comes right out and says _Naw, we like our privilege. Fuck you all!_ It's the coward's way out, and the way they think they're being "manly" when they act like total assholes makes my stomach churn.

But equally upsetting is when the performative "good guys"â€”the Justin Baldoni's of the worldâ€”get exposed. Alas, this isn't my first rodeo on that front. I was a _huge_ fan of very Jewish shock comedian Jamie Kilstein a number of years backâ€”he'd already been through a cancellation during a stint as a loud-and-proud liberal, but he'd bounced back to some degree and was trying to portray himself as an open-minded political moderate. (Nowadays I would instantly see that as a red flag, but back then I admired it.) But surprise, surpriseâ€”all of a sudden he ended up cozying up to Tim Pool (!!), started hanging out with other alt-right types, and now he's married and openly a "Christian" (sorry, I don't buy it for a minute). And [this is who he recently interviewed](https://drdrew.com)â€”definitely moderate huh. ðŸ™„

So yeah. Guys getting red-pilled, "feminists" getting exposed, religious manly men going off the deep end, CEOs becoming drunk with absolute powerâ€¦it is _bleak_ out there. And [as I already wrote about](/20241211/post-toxic-masculinity), while I appreciated the "tonic masculinity" of Tim Walz which made a big national splash for a hot minute there, I also didn't find a whole lot to relate to personally. (I'm not going to restore my prized jalopy any time soon. I guess I must be a communist because I hate cars!)

### Where to Go from Hereâ€¦

I'm afraid I don't have many answers right now. I feel like the "brand" of "being a man" has never been more in the toiletâ€”at least here in America. And with the incoming Trump 2.0 administration which is absolutely bone-chilling in too many ways to count, the future of manhood at the national level is dark indeed.

All I can say is this: **I'll keep speaking out on this topic**. I'll keep writing about masculinity on my blog. I'll keep thinking about my own gender expression and how that's evolving. I can tell you right now, 2025 will be a year of experimentation for me. I'm going to slingshot _gender conformance_ right into the heart of the sun. Because if "being a man" means being like all of these people who have shown themselves to be truly awful humans, then **fuck being a man**.

I'll be something else.
