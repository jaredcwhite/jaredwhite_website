Folks, it's high time I spent a little time highlighting one of the very cool places I've discovered while on the road living the [#NomadLifestyle](/tag/nomadlifestyle){:.hashtag}, so welcome to this first installment of **Very Cool Places I've Discovered While On the Road** (still workshopping that oneâ€¦)

[Silverton, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverton,_Oregon) is a small town of some ten thousand souls nestled on the eastern edge of the Willamette Valley where it starts to turn into the western side of the Cascade Mountains. It's about an hour's drive southeast from Portland, and less than a half-hour away from the state capital of Salem.

Now I'd been there once or twice in the past and certainly came away impressed, but it's one thing to stop randomly at a town for a bite to eat while you're heading somewhere else, and it's another thing entirely to _go to a place_ and spend significant time there.

**Silverton is, simply put, one of the most lovely spots in all of Oregonâ€”lovely in the sense that nearly everywhere you walk you feel like you are looking at gardens.** It should come as no surprise that "[The Oregon Garden](https://oregongarden.org)" is literally a Silverton destination, an 80-acre botanical garden which I didn't go to because I'm a cheapskate and didn't buy admission. But did I need to?

Silverton's city center is small but very quaint, with a number of cute shops, cafÃ©s, dinner establishments, and an [awesome food cart pod](https://theden-silverton.com) (_try the pizza, it's delish!_). In addition, Silverton is the gateway town to get to [Silver Falls](https://visitsilverfalls.com), which apparently is the largest state park in Oregon. I went there in 2019 and was blown away by the setting and the photos I was able to take, [like this one](https://jaredwhite.com/pictures/20190903/1) and [this one](https://jaredwhite.com/pictures/20190906/1).

You can also make your way up towards the town of Molalla and take the road east along the Molalla River (itself quite scenic in spots) into the [Table Rock Wilderness](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington/table-rock-wilderness), one of my absolute favorite places in the Cascades outside of the major peaks themselves. This is an area managed by BLM (Bureau of Land Management) and feels truly remote after only a short drive in.

I will go on record that not every corner of the Willamette Valley is visually all that impressive. Some areas are just flat and mainly consist of farms or rural industry. Some of the small towns certainly won't knock your socks off (_sorry Lebanon!_). But Silverton is high on my list of must-see destinations in this region. And if you take the very vibe-y drive between Silverton and Sublimity, at a certain time of year you might just get treated to a view like this:
