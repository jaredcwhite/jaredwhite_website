title: A Nomadâ€™s Pacific Northwest Travelogue, Part II
subtitle: Messy as hell, yet thoroughly delicious!

Where [last we left our intrepid hero](/articles/a-nomads-pnw-travelogue-part-i) (that's me, in case you were wondering), I had survived a hailstorm in Portland, spent a weekend with my kids in Corvallis, and was ready to hit the road to celebrate St. Patrick's Day and stay a couple-ish weeks with my brother Shayne in the languorous hamlet of Kent, Washington.

The drive up I-5 was uneventful, yet quite pleasant. I arrived in Shayne's neck of the woods in the early afternoon, while he was still at work, so I headed to the library in nearby Covington to get some work of my own done.

  <figcaption>Naturally, it was nestled in the woodsâ€”cozy fireplace and all</figcaption>
</figure>

Once back at Shayne's abode, I unpacked and got settled in a bit, then we hightailed it over to Kent's premier Irish pub, [The Harp Bar and Restaurant](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-harp-bar-and-restaurant-kent).

Despite the loud festivities and the jostling of too many patrons in too small of a space, our time there was grand. I had the bangers & mash, and Shayne had a lamb stew if memory serves. Though I myself haven't been back to Ireland since 1998, I felt like the cuisine here had a truly authentic flair and was very tasty.

### An Aside About Mood Swings

Feel free to skip this section if you are here mainly for the fun pix. I want to be as honest as I can about both the good and the bad of living as a nomad. The good isâ€¦incredible experiences traveling, duh! ðŸ˜…

The bad is something I wasn't really prepared for, and to be honest it hasn't completely gone away even though it's significantly less acute than at first: **frequent mood swings.**

Maybe this is a me thing. Maybe other travelers don't experience this. I don't know, but I wish someone had warned me that numerous times throughout the course of a single day I might go from some pretty high highs to some pretty low lows and back again. One minute, you're beholding a breathtaking vista at a time of day you'd never normally be there (perhaps it's early morning or late in the evening when otherwise you'd be "home"). The next minute, you feel like crap and wonder what in the hell you're doing wandering across the face of the earth when normal people are enjoying a respite in their secure abode.

Let me be clear: **this is really not a comfort issue.** I have _enjoyed_ the physical activity of traveling and sleeping in my car or at times a hotel room or AirBnb (or in this case, my bro's place), and I have rarely been bothered by that aspect per se. It's more of a mental/emotional thing. Sometimes it's really stressful trying to figure out where you're going to land, and if you're going to feel "safe" falling asleep wherever that might be. Other times, it's more about the statusâ€”my "place" in this world. If I am technically houseless, doesn't that make me a loser? Aren't losers the people who don't have a place to stay other than their vehicle? (Never mind the fact that _I freely chose to do this!_ I wanted to do this. I dunno, brains can be real weird sometimesâ€¦)

At any rate, like I said I'm doing much better now on this front than the first couple weeks or so. Spending lots of quality time with Shayne on this particular trip probably helped a lot as well.

Speaking of which, let's return now to our story!

### Hello Seattle!

It's mandatory [you play the Owl City song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uvc46jujn8) as you read this section. _Mandatory, I tell you!_

The day after St. Patrick'sâ€”once sufficiently recoveredâ€”I drove to the Angle Lake train station and took the Link light rail into the city. Shayne had another day of work, and I was planning to meet up with a friend I met on Mastodon. But not before some adequate sightseeing!

Once I'd played the tourist and ridden my e-scooter up and down the new Alaskan Way bike path enough times, I headed on up to Capitol Hill to meet my friend for lunch. He had selected [Oddfellows](https://www.oddfellowscafe.com), and like a good Millennial I ordered the avocado toast with a side of poached egg.

After our lengthy and delightful camaraderie, I wandered around the neighborhood a bit and made a mental note to come back to this combo bike shop and cafÃ© one day!

After spending a while remote working and imbibing on some truly excellent coffee, it was time to grab a train ride back to my car. _Or so I thought!_ I was starting to get hungry again, so I got off at the Beacon Hill stop and rode my scooter down various steep and winding roads to get to the bottom. Fun! But I wasn't sure where I might partake of a snack. Then I saw [the most hole-in-the-wall place](https://www.theoriginalphillys.com) you've ever encountered. I decided to give it a try. Despite it being oriented around the philly cheesesteak I ordered something vegetarian with lots of peppers. It was messy as hell, yet thoroughly delicious!

Back on the train again, I returned to Kent for some much needed R&R and hanging out with my bro.

### Issaquah and Bellevue

It was free Washington State Parks day, so while Shayne was at work I decided to meander my way up to a park not too far away. That turned out to be Squak Mountain State Park, just south of Issaquah. I wasn't sure I'd get much out of this particular trip at firstâ€¦the day was pretty gray and moist, and initially the trail just looked like firs and fernsâ€”aka pretty much anywhere in northwestern Washington.

But then I got a little ways up the mountain and started to feel those glorious moody forest vibes. _Noice!_ I even shot some "professional" photos with my fancy camera (the Nikon Z fc):

  </fig-images>
  <figcaption>Left: Yep, that's a temperate rainforest alright<br/>Right: Tree guesses what this is</figcaption>
</figure>

Eventually my forest time came to its logical conclusion and I was back on the road headed for Bellevue. I've been here a number of times in the past, and despite the very "corporate" vibes in parts of downtown, I really do enjoy this city. The very large downtown park square is quite a worthy destination.

  <figcaption>It might be even better at night. Imagine walking under this!</figcaption>
</figure>

That evening I went out to have drinks with Shayne and a buddy of his at a _very highfalutin rooftop bar_ in Bellevue. For some reason I didn't get any photos of the view, but [you can check out their Yelp page for examples](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ascend-prime-steak-and-sushi-bellevue-9).

The next day wasn't particularly eventful and the weather wasn't too good, so mainly I got a bit more work done and hung out with Shayne at homeâ€”among other things [playing the latest "Rime" update to Myst](https://cyan.com/2025/03/18/press-release-new-age-brings-additional-intrigue-to-2020-myst-remake/).

### Point Defiance, and the Reason I Was Here at All

On Friday, it was time for us bros to go exploring (before the big event of the eveningâ€¦stay tuned for the fabulous details)! First, we stopped to have a delightful lunch at Marlene's Market & Deli in Federal Way.

</figure>

Then we headed on out past Tacoma to a point of land northwest of town and arrived at our destination: [Point Defiance Park](https://www.parkstacoma.gov/place/point-defiance-park/).

The entire coastline of the Puget Sound from here down to Steliacoom or thereabouts is absolutely jaw-dropping. The Tacoma Narrows bridge spans a particularly dreamy area, and you can see that from the southern side of Point Defiance. But the park encompasses many other attractions, some of which we didn't even get to see such as a zoo. We primarily walked through the gardens, along the shore, and across various woodland trails.

Eventually the rain came back with a vengeance, and we returned to Kent in the nick of time to attend the **main attraction**. You see, I was destined to be here with Shayne long before I had actually decided to do the nomad thing this year, and that was because he had purchased tickets for us to attend an Irish music concert by the band [LÃºnasa](https://www.lunasamusic.com). Yes indeed!

And with that taste of wondrous Emerald Isle merry-making, **I now bid thee farewell** until my next installment of the Travel(b)logue series. Come back soon and join us as we visit a variety of Seattle museums, each more thrilling than the last!
