title: A Nomad‚Äôs Pacific Northwest Travelogue, Part III
subtitle: A celebration of the military-industrial complex! Also aliens, monsters, and plants made of glass!

Where [last we left our intrepid hero](/articles/a-nomads-pnw-travelogue-part-ii) (‚Ä¶me‚Ä¶that's me!), I had successfully made my way up from Oregon to Washington to stay with my best brother\* Shayne and enjoy the sights and sounds of Seattle, Point Defiance, and the brilliant Irish band L√∫nasa.

\* (Also my only brother, but don't get hung up on that minor detail!)

Now it was Saturday, and we decided to make a day of it exploring two of the more eccentric art museums in Seattle: [Chihuly Garden and Glass](https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com) and [Museum of Pop Culture](https://www.mopop.org) (also known as MOPOP). These are extremely popular destinations for Seattle tourists as they are both located in the broader region known as [Seattle Center](https://seattlecenter.com) where one other famous landmark happens to reside.

I _love_ hanging out at the International Fountain, and [back in 2021 I published a whole vlog episode](https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20210917/seattle-travel-vlog-part-2) including it and other Seattle highlights on a trip with my kids.

Anyway, we just so happened to be visiting the area on the same day as the [Seattle Color Festival](https://www.seattlecenter.com/events/event-calendar/seattle-color-festival), which meant we were constantly passing people whose skin & clothing were all colors of the rainbow. Festive indeed!

### Q: What is a Chihuly

The proper question is _who_ is Chihuly, but that merely demonstrates my ignorance going into this experience. I'll be honest, I never would have come here if it weren't for my brother‚Ä¶and I'm _so_ glad he talked me into it.

The answer is **Dale Chihuly**, a Tacoma-born artist who has been renowned the world over for many decades for his breathtaking glass sculptures and architectural installations. While I will go on record saying glass isn't a medium I have a particular emotional affinity for (I'm much more of a stone/crystals/ceramics guy), I nevertheless found my socks getting knocked off on multiple occasions as we toured this museum.

### It is Very Cold‚Ä¶in Space!

After our tour of Chihuly Garden and Glass concluded we stopped to catch our breath, then made our way over to MOPOP for an experience that was‚Äîshall we say‚Äîcompletely different. As a person who is very much into the nerdier aspects of pop culture, MOPOP tickled my fancy real hard.

### Capitol, Capitol

With our lengthy forays into wonders of the Seattle museum scene over (for now), Shayne and I made our way over to the Capitol Hill neighborhood for a round of drinks, a walk, dinner, another walk, and then a train ride up to the U District to meet up with one of Shayne's buddies for another round of drinks and a mesmerizing view of the northern Seattle skyline.

**Full disclosure:** While I think the campus of the University of Washington is truly gorgeous ([see this vlog episode for a walkthrough](https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20191118/walking-tour-of-university-of-washington-seattle-vlog)), I'm not a big fan of the U District. Unless you have a particular stop in mind here (like meeting up for friends), I'd recommend staying clear. There are many other Seattle neighborhoods worth your attention‚ÄîCapitol Hill certainly being one of them!

### A Note About Shayne's Baller Music

I should put in a word about Shayne's musical prowess. In case you're not aware (why would you be?), we used to perform together in a Celtic band called [Distant Oaks](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6676411) many moons ago; more recently, Shayne has been [a prolific producer of retro-flavored electronica](https://shayne.bandcamp.com) ([as have I!](https://yarred.com/music)).

Shayne's latest release, or I should say 15th anniversary re-release, of **Curve** is a truly fine work in my opinion‚Äîespecially [the title track](https://shayne.bandcamp.com/track/curve-2025-new-track) which is actually a brand-new composition. If that tickles your fancy, [They Tower Above Us](https://shayne.bandcamp.com/track/they-tower-above-us-shaynes-instrumental-version) is another one of my all-time favorites.

### And Here's Where Things Get‚Ä¶Uncomfortable

Now before you start to wail _why does EVERYTHING have to be about politics?!?!_, let me just say‚Ä¶nope, sorry, I got nuthin'. **This section is about politics.**

As a final destination during my trip, we returned once again to Seattle to complete our trifecta of museum trips by visiting [The Museum of Flight](https://www.museumofflight.org). Now on a superficial level I did have quite a nice time here‚Ä¶all of the displays of historical aircraft, a large exhibit centered on rocket science and the moon landing, a tour of a to-scale Space Shuttle replica, extensive displays of planes used during the dogfights of World Wars I & II, and even a walkthrough of what was once the Nixon administration's Air Force One‚Äîwell it was all very thrilling.

But upon reflection after the fact, a nagging thought in the back of my head blossomed into a full train of contemplation on the fact that the museum was essentially one giant love letter to **the Military-Industrial Complex**. Honestly, it was a bit odd that many of the exhibits were a backdoor into extolling the endless virtues of **The Boeing Company.** Perhaps that's simply a matter of convenience, as the original "red barn" of Boeing where early planes were manufactured is on museum property‚Äîand Boeing is of course a Seattle institution.

However it's like if you were to go to a "Museum of Shoes" in the Portland, Oregon area and a huge portion of the exhibits were simply adverts for Nike. Sure, it makes sense in a way‚Ä¶_but also, ick?_

Despite what you may have heard, airplanes are not "neutral" technologies. They consume vast amounts of resources. We are in the midst of a global climate catastrophe and people are increasingly questioning the merits of travel via these airborne vehicles which burn carbon-emitting fuel like crazy. Not only that, there are countless historical wrongs of Eurocentric Colonialism which were made all the easier by the use of planes. Heck, the museum even had exhibits on how the invention of flight (aka "bush planes") helped foster rapid American settlement of Alaska in the early 1900s; and here I am wondering [how the existing native populations felt about all that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Natives#American_colonialism). 

I suppose I would have similar qualms about a "Museum of Automobiles" based in Detroit or whatever. üá∫üá∏ _Rah rah USA! USA!_ üá∫üá∏ (Let's not talk about how gasoline extraction, engine & tire pollution, and multi-ton metallic boxes are destroying our environment and killing children‚Ä¶)

All that being said, **I got some cool photos.** Here are a few. üòÖ

### Ice Cream, Green Lake, and Saying Goodbye

I'm not often an ice cream guy, and my brother even less so, but nevertheless once we finished our museum tour I talked him into taking me to my favorite ice cream spot in Seattle, [Molly Moon](https://www.mollymoon.com). And the sundae I got there was even _better_ than I could have anticipated!

After this, we headed over to Green Lake for a leisurely afternoon stroll around the lake and the broader neighborhood. I'd never been to this part of the city before, and I'll _definitely_ be returning here again in the near future.

And with that, I bid my brother Shayne a bittersweet farewell and waved goodbye to Washington. Over the next few days, I made my way back down to Portland and eventually landed once more in **Eugene, Oregon** to spend Spring Break weekend with my kids. I'll share a few more photos from that timeframe, and then finally tease a shot of the _incredible destination_ I arrived at next (but that will have to wait for a future travelogue installment!).
