title: A Nomad’s Pacific Northwest Travelogue, Part I
---

My journey began February 28. I handed in the keys. My car was packed. My storage unit was stuffed. I was ready to hit the road\*.

\* (To a certain degree. It was my weekend with the kids, so I actually drove partway to where they live with their mom and we stayed at a fun hotel in Corvallis, Oregon…a lovely little college town next to the Willamette River.)

After the weekend festivities, my first **car camping** excursions were in and around the Eugene & Springfield area—also a nice (larger) college town next to the Willamette River. And when I say next to the river, I really mean it _embraces_ the river (much in the same way that Portland does).

Alas—from an urbanist perspective, there are a lot of questionable aspects of this region. Yes, they've made strides to build out a bike network as well as a BRT line called EmX. For cyclists, the paths on either side of the river are *fantastic*, and if you're a tourist you can easily rent a bike from many downtown kiosks.

But stray a ways away from "the good places" and it gets bad real fast—especially West Eugene which I tried (and failed) to avoid. Imagine the worst of East Portland, and that's West Eugene.

**Thankfully, the good places are good indeed.** I thoroughly enjoyed a combination beer hall & food cart pod in Eugene called [Beergarden](https://www.beergardenme.com), as well as a cutesy coffee shop just a smidge south of the main thoroughfare called [Meraki Coffee & Co](https://www.drinkmeraki.com/).

Beyond the city center, I thoroughly enjoyed the areas near the river or up in the hills and found some great parks, such as [Dorris Ranch](https://www.willamalane.org/places/dorris-ranch) in Springfield.

Also shoutout to [Shotgun Creek Recreation Site](https://www.blm.gov/visit/shotgun-creek-recreation-site) which is BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land in the hills northeast of Springfield where there are plenty of places to park as well as a staging area for OHVs (Off-Road Vehicles) if you're into that sort of thing.

### A Note About "Car Camping"

You may be wondering what I mean when I say car camping. For me, it's basically the stripped-down version of "hashtag Van Life". My car is my home. I travel in it, work it in, eat in it, relax in it, and sleep in it (I'm pleasantly surprised how cozy my bed is after some initial effort getting the right combo of a bottom board and foam mattresses). I stay in places where overnight parking is permitted…my favorite locations of course being real campgrounds or "dispersed camping" areas (on public lands like state or national forests or BLM), but highway rest stops are also a (mostly) decent option. In-town street parking in a pinch, yes, but that's a real mixed bag and I try to avoid it if I can.

There are also "AirBnB but for camping" apps out there such as [Hipcamp](https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US) (more on that in future installments), and you can also get connected with the Van Life community to find some more out-of-the-way places which cater to the nomadic community in particular. I'm just starting to learn about a lot of this myself!

### Back to Portland (The Highlights)

...

### Tip of the Northern Oregon Coast

Because the weather in Oregon in early March was pretty wet and cold-ish, it took me a while to start getting out to "awesome places" (not that Portland and there areas thereabouts aren't awesome!), so I'll just share another highlight

[Fort Stevens State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=129) is right at the tip of land west of Astoria and Youngs Bay and south of Baker Bay and Cape Disappointment on the Washington State side of the Columbia River. I regret that I only stayed here one night, because even with the wind and the rain, it was absolutely _gorgeous_. A beautiful campground easily accessible, yet once there you felt like you were in the middle of a quiet coastal forest (because you were!). Hiking and biking trails galore, yet with that maritime vibe.

I'm definitely going back, although as the weather rapidly improves I'm sure it'll start to be harder to find camping sites to reserve. Anything along the Oregon coast goes into _high_ demand once the seasons head towards summer.
