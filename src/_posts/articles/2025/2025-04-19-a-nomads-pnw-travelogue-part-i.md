My journey began February 28. I handed in the keys. My car was packed. My storage unit was stuffed. I was ready to hit the road\*.

\* (To a certain degree. It was my weekend with the kids, so I actually drove partway to where they live with their mom and we stayed at a fun hotel in Corvallis, Oregonâ€¦a lovely little college town next to the Willamette River.)

_Note: Most of these photos & videos are raw and unedited, right out of my iPhone Pro camera._

After the weekend festivities, my first true **car camping** excursions were in and around the Eugene & Springfield areaâ€”also a nice (larger) college town next to the Willamette River. And when I say next to the river, I really mean it _embraces_ the river (much in the same way that Portland does).

Alasâ€”from an urbanist perspective, there are some truly questionable aspects of this region. Yes, they've made strides to build out a bike network as well as a BRT line called EmX. For cyclists, the paths on either side of the river are *fantastic*, and if you're a tourist you can easily rent a bike from many downtown kiosks.

But stray a ways away from "the good places" and it gets bad real fastâ€”especially West Eugene which I tried (and failed) to avoid. Imagine the worst of East Portland, and that's West Eugene.

**Thankfully, the good places are good indeed.** I thoroughly enjoyed a combination beer hall & food cart pod in Eugene called [Beergarden](https://www.beergardenme.com), as well as a cutesy coffee shop just a smidge south of the main thoroughfare called [Meraki Coffee & Co](https://www.drinkmeraki.com/).

Beyond the city center(s), I thoroughly enjoyed the areas near the river or up in the hills and found some lovely parks, such as [Dorris Ranch](https://www.willamalane.org/places/dorris-ranch) in Springfield.

Also shoutout to [Shotgun Creek Recreation Site](https://www.blm.gov/visit/shotgun-creek-recreation-site) which is BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land in the hills northeast of Springfield where there are plenty of places to park and unwind as well as a staging area for OHVs (Off-Road Vehicles) if you're into that sort of thing.

### A Note About "Car Camping"

You may be wondering what I mean when I say car camping. For me, it's basically the stripped-down version of "hashtag Van Life". My car is my home. I travel in it, work it in, eat in it, relax in it, and sleep in it (I'm pleasantly surprised how cozy my bed is after some initial effort getting the right combo of a bottom board and foam mattresses). I stay in places where overnight parking is permittedâ€¦my favorite locations of course being real campgrounds or "dispersed camping" areas (on public lands like state or national forests or BLM), but highway rest stops are also a (mostly) decent option. In-town street parking in a pinch, yes, but that's a real mixed bag and I try to avoid it if I can.

There are also "AirBnB but for camping" apps out there such as [Hipcamp](https://www.hipcamp.com/en-US) (more on that in future installments), and you can also get connected with the Van Life community to find some more out-of-the-way places which cater to the nomadic community in particular. I'm just starting to learn about a lot of this myself!

I'll have more to say about the mechanics of car camping in later installmentsâ€¦such as what you do when you need to brush your teeth and you're super tired and don't feel like putting pants back on and crawling out of your vehicle and stumbling through the cold and the dark in an unfamiliar campground just to find a sink. ðŸ˜…

### Back to Portland (The Highlights)

The following week I had some business in Portland to attend to, so I hightailed it back to my old stomping groundsâ€¦but now with a new perspective of being a traveler. It's always fun to pretend to be a tourist in your own town, and now I could really do it! A few highlights:

I'll be real honest. I didn't totally dig Flock at firstâ€¦it felt very _rich tourist-oriented_ and wasn't giving off those authentic "Keep Portland Weird" vibes. But then [I read this article](https://bridgetownbites.com/2025/01/30/flock-food-hall-first-look-portland-oregon/) about the push for diversity in this new food hall and how all the vendors are BIPOC-owned, so that made me feel better.

And finallyâ€¦

### Tip of the Northern Oregon Coast

Because the weather in Oregon in early March was pretty wet and cold-ish, it took me a while to start getting out to "awesome places" (not that Portland and there areas thereabouts aren't awesome!).

One major exception: [Fort Stevens State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=129).

It's located right at the tip of land west of Astoria and Youngs Bay and south of Baker Bay and Cape Disappointment on the Washington State side of the Columbia River. I regret that I only stayed here one night, because even with the wind and the rain, it was absolutely _gorgeous_. A beautiful campground easily accessible, yet once there you felt like you were in the middle of a quiet coastal forest (because you were!). Hiking and biking trails galore, yet with that maritime vibe.

</figure>

Even though I got to my campsite rather late, I hadn't brought much food with me so I decided to see if I could find a nearby town with a cool spot to get a bit of grub and do a bit of work. And I did!

  <fig-images>

  <figcaption>In nearby Hammond, my wish was granted at the delightful <a href="http://www.southjettybar.com">South Jetty Dining Room & Bar</a> where I had a glass of wine and <em>fantastic</em> clam chowder</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm definitely going back, although as the weather rapidly improves I'm sure it'll start to be harder to find camping sites to reserve. Anything along the Oregon coast goes into _high_ demand once the seasons head towards summer.

### All Hail (the Storm!)

I arrived back in Portland in time for a meetup, only everyone got scared away (not me) because the weather suddenly (and I mean _suddenly_) went bonkers! ðŸ˜±

Thankfully, things calmed down after that and I managed to find my way over to a place I'd never been to before near Goose Hollow / Nob Hill for some light grub before heading back out of town for another kids weekend in Corvallis.

### Getting Ready for St. Patrick's Day (and My Next Trip)

Part I of my travelogue now draws to a close. I had fun exploring more of Corvallis, particularly Oregon State University, and the kids and I did some shopping at a nearby mall to get ready for the holiday.

</figure>

After my kids and I said our goodbyes, I thoroughly enjoyed a glass of ale at the always excellent [Treebeard's Taphouse](https://www.treebeerdstaphouse.com) (there's also a great location in Portland as well) to get into the spirit of things before the following day which was St. Patrick's Day.

</figure>

But that's a tale for another timeâ€”a rousing story about visiting my brother Shayne up in Washington State and exploring all sorts of groovy areas in and around Seattle (among other things).

I'll leave you with this parting message I was surprised to find at a truck stop restroom in a "red" area of central Oregon. I think maybe people are getting pretty upset about these dudes! ðŸ˜…
