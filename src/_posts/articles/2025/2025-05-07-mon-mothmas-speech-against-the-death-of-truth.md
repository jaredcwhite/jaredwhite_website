Take heed: the following might be considered a spoiler if you haven’t yet seen _Star Wars: Andor_ Season 2 Episode 9.

In this episode, Senator Mon Mothma delivers a speech in the Galactic Senate before she is cut off and the video feed is shut down. The following is an excerpt after her formal introductions up to the point she is barred from speaking further. Yes, it touches on events that happen in a TV show on Disney+. It's just fantasy. It's "entertainment". **And yet it strikes at the heart of the very real crisis in our American politics we are now grappling with every day.**

We have gladly allowed the many decades of _Star Wars_ to tickle our romantic notions of heroism and mythic glory. This is good! May it _also_ speak to us as people who recognize [we need stories like this to spur us to action in standing up for truth and justice in our own place and time](/podcast/124/).

**Senator Mon Mothma, I yield you the floor.**

I believe we are in crisis.  
The distance between what is said and what is known to be true  
has become an abyss.

Of all the things at risk,  
The loss of an objective reality is perhaps the most dangerous.  
The death of truth is the ultimate victory of evil.

When truth leaves us,  
When we let is slip away,  
When it is ripped from our hands,  
We become vulnerable to the appetite  
of whatever monster screams the loudest.

This chamber’s hold on the truth  
was finally lost on the Ghorman plaza.  
What took place yesterday,  
What happened yesterday on Ghorman  
was unprovoked genocide. Yes! Genocide!

And that truth has been exiled from this chamber!  
And the monster screaming the loudest?  
The monster we’ve helped create?  
The monster who will come for us all soon enough  
is [Emperor Palpatine](https://www.newsweek.com/white-house-donald-trump-king-time-2033574#slideshow/2591956)!
