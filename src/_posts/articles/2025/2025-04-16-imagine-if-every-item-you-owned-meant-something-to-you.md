Perhaps some people are fortunate. They have spent many years carefully curating all the items in their possession, discarding those entries which aren't fit to purpose or aren't sufficiently aesthetic or nostalgic. The only things remaining in their house are those things which, to reference Marie Kondo, "spark joy".

**I was never so fortunate.**

### The Circle of Life 

Like I suspect most young adults in their teens and early 20s, when I moved into my own place, I really didn't have much stuff at all and most of the stuff I did have was the random assortment of items I'd inherited from my parents or taken with me from my bedroom (which largely originated with my parents!). And when I *did* buy new things, much of the time it was because (a) it was cheap, and (b) I needed it. Utility above all else.

Then in my late 20s, I got married. Suddenly I had a _ton_ of things in _our_ house, many of which I had absolutely no say over because obviously they were the property of my wife. Moving forward, our stuff was an amalgam of things I wanted, things she wanted, and things neither of us wanted but we hadn't bothered to remove or replace. Add kids into the mix, and the lines are blurred even further (and the clutter accumulates exponentially!).

**Then, in my late 30s, I got divorced.** And in somewhat of a similar fashion to my previous decade, I ended up with a hodgepodge of items some of which were mine, some of which were my ex-wife's that she wasn't partial to—and of course, some of which were my kids.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year [when I made the decision](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/123) to transition to the [#NomadLifestyle](/tag/nomadlifestyle/) for a season. Since I knew I would be renting a not-terribly-large storage unit and anything not coming along with me for the ride would _have_ to fit into that unit, I began the serious process of downsizing. And in that process, and even now as I still ponder this new leg of my life's journey, I've realized something rather horrifying:

**There was hardly anything in my possession I truly loved.**

### What is Valuable 

In the past, I might have brushed off this thought entirely. After all, perhaps that's a good thing! I should "value experiences" or people over material things. Or perhaps it was simply a sign of me being thrifty: why spend a bunch of money on a fancy-pants table napkin when a sponge works just fine?

But _this is the year_ when I've been carefully and methodically revisiting all of my life's choices and giving heed to anything about my habits, routines, even personality I feel no longer serves my best interests now and in the future. And a singular thought has begun to dawn for me:

**What if every one of my possessions were actually extremely valuable?**

Now this begs the question: what is valuable? I don't merely take this to mean expensive. In some cases, yes, that may very well be the case. But when I say valuable, I mean _this item is valuable to me_. It is _meaningful_. It is _appreciated_. It _has a story_. It has _presence_. In other word, it's _got a vibe_.

And to a certain degree, it is _exclusive_. Put simply: **I would rather own one really, really, really, really great fork than own a dozen crappy forks.** Extrapolate that to nearly everything else. Instead of a bunch of shirts I don't particularly care for—have just a handful of awesome shirts I _love_ to wear, that are meaningful to me in some real way. Instead (once I am permanently housed again) of a bunch of paintings and photos hanging on walls most of which I don't particularly fancy at this point, I have one or two art pieces which are *striking* and inspiring. Instead of a bunch of cheap-ass chairs none of which are particularly attractive or comfortable, maybe I only own one chair which is the best damn chair ever.

**I think you get the point.**

Rather than pride myself on my lack of care in the material world I surround myself with, like somehow I'm more spiritual or more practical that way, I have come to realize I want the exact opposite. **I want to stop being cheap.** I want to purchase things even that are expensive—not because of the status of it, but because _it's well-made_, perhaps even handmade, sourced with high-quality materials and crafted with real artistry.

In lieu of being rich, however, this new approach definitely requires a degree of sacrifice. **I'm OK with that.** I would rather live in a small dwelling that's mostly empty—but what _is_ in it is fabulous—than live in a large house filled with disposable nonsense and cheap garbage. I found it quite depressing, in fact, as I was putting the stuff I did end up keeping into my storage unit, that the vast majority of items I was storing had virtually no value. Nobody else would care to spend any real money acquiring these items. You could poof most of those items out of existence, then replace them with similar items from the usual national chains and discount stores, and nobody really could tell the difference.

**Honestly, I was aghast.** How could I, as an "artist", as a creative person, as someone who ostensibly cares deeply about aesthetics and fit and form and finish, stand to surround myself with total crap?

It started to make me wonder if this had been a real drag on my mental health for some time and I hadn't even realized it until now. The only explanation I could come up with (other than just not wanting to or not being able to spend a lot of money) is that I've spent so much of my life caring deeply about the _digital world_, and not so much the _physical world_. The boundaries of my artistic sensibilities had been set mainly to the confines of my screens, and thus to a fair degree everything beyond suffered.

**Ultimately, I had become my own worst enemy.** By continuing to place myself—to be perfectly honest—in a slobby mess of an abode, I was slowly crushing my own spirit.

### A Total Reset of My Physical World

There's a host of reasons I'm now rocking the nomadic lifestyle, living as a true minimalist, but one of the reasons it seems I've discovered in hindsight and wasn't necessarily part of my original plan. And that is the chance to _reset_ what I choose to surround myself with.

I'm done with the hand-me-downs.

**I'm done with the detritus of past relationships and failed endeavors.**

I'm done with the stuff that's lazily obtained and cheaply made.

I'm done with anything that isn't imbued with real meaning and artistry and "good vibes".

And yes, this does mean it may take a long time—years even—to slowly and methodically build up an inventory of a household once again. But I am confident I will be _far_ happier and _far_ more appreciative of what I have and will have as I embark on this totally new philosophy.

Past me might have scoffed at the idea I might one day spend several thousands dollars on a single table (handcrafted by a local artisan). Future me? I'm certainly not ruling out the possibility.

But the crazy thing is some items you can get _actually don't cost much money_—yet because of where you obtained them or how you obtained them or from whom you obtained them, **they mean so much more** than just some generic haul you picked up at Target.

Not everything is valuable in a purely monetary sense (although I'm training myself to avoid passing judgement if something _is_ costly). What ultimately matters, as I keep saying, is if it is valuable _to you_.

And it took me giving up virtually everything to realize _how much I wish I cared more_ about what it was I was giving up.
