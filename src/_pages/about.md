### Hello

I‚Äôm Jared White, and this is my website on the internet. I write about topics that I care about and believe are important. I try to bring my authentic voice every time I set out to type, and I strive to share a viewpoint that gets you thinking and inspired to dig deeper.

What are some of the topics I write about? Generally you‚Äôll see me covering:

- The Open Web and the Future of News and Social Media
- Mindfulness & Spirituality
- Geek Culture (Indie Art, Sci-Fi, etc.)
- Apple Devices & Ecosystem
- Creative Computing Tools
- Exploring the Pacific Northwest
- Anything else that strikes my fancy

My tagline <strike>says</strike> once said that I‚Äôm a writer, musician, open web advocate, programmer, designer, and sci-fi nerd. Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit, shall we?

### Writer

When I first arrived on the internet in 1994, it wasn‚Äôt very long before I discovered that anyone could create their own website. All you needed were some HTML skills and the ability to conjure up a few decent image files for backgrounds or logos. And so in 1996 I created my first website, _Jared White‚Äôs Internet Review_, which featured reviews of cool things I found on the internet. (Essentially what everybody was doing back then!) After a while the site was redesigned and renamed [iReview](http://web.archive.org/web/19990828044105/http://www.gaeldesign.adei.com/ireview/home.asp), and I also wrote for several other tech publications in the late 90s (most notably _MyDesktop_ and Paul Thurrott‚Äôs _Internet Nexus_).

After some time passed I shut down iReview and focused on my burgeoning career as a web designer and software developer. But throughout the 2000s, I always had some sort of blog up and running, writing about tech, design, or spirituality topics. (What a surprise!)

The funny thing is it wasn‚Äôt until around 2012 that I came to the realization that [I am a Writer](/articles/i-am-a-writer) with a capital W. You see, I had always considered my ‚Äúcalling‚Äù to be in music, and my ‚Äúprofession‚Äù to be in the software space, but writing was just something I did because...well, that‚Äôs what everybody online did. Except I finally realized that assumption was faulty‚Äîlots of people don‚Äôt write frequently, don‚Äôt have blogs, don‚Äôt try to communicate with an audience of readers on a regular basis. In other words, writing and publishing online felt so natural to me, I didn‚Äôt realize it was actually a valuable skill!

So here I am, writing as a citizen of the internet no matter what the occasion, because that is Who I Am.

### Musician

Music has always been a huge part of my life. I took up piano at age 5, recorder at 10, and soon after picked up a variety of ethnic wind instruments including bagpipes.

I joined my mother‚Äôs Celtic and Early Music band _Distant Oaks_ in 1993. I began recording professionally from the tender age of 11, and toured with the band across several states and in Scotland and Ireland from 1995 to 2005.

One of my greatest honors was to perform music at a private dinner function held at **Robert Mondavi Winery**. The Mondavi family themselves were present, and they along with their fellow business partners saluted us musicians, much to our amazement. And to top it all off, the staff invited us to partake of Napa-quality food and wine. Quite a classy bunch!

As part of _Distant Oaks_, I was fortunate to collaborate with incredibly talented musicians in the Folk and Early Music genres, including David Douglass, Cheryl Ann Fulton, Jerry O‚ÄôSullivan, Barry Phillips, Kit Higginson, Julie Jeffrey, and Shira Kammen.

After my mother passed away in 2005 and _Distant Oaks_ disbanded, my focus graduatly shifted to electronic music production and performing on synthesizers. I recorded two albums along with my brother Shayne as _Binary Sea_ in the late 2000s, before embarking on my solo career as _Yarred_.

Over the past 10 years, I've developed a signature sound with influences ranging from classic 80s electronic music to ambient to downtempo to progressive house. My performance style combines DJ-inspired live groove production with virtuosic keyboard playing on analog and digital synthesizers.

### Open Web Advocate

In 2010, Wired Magazine famously published an article titled _The Web is Dead. Long Live the Internet_ in which the authors describe a world where we've all succumbed to using proprietary apps and closed platforms to read news and communicate online, and the web itself has devolved into a dumb transport layer for all these apps. Who needs private servers, open source code, domains, URLs, or HTML? We'll all be quite happy using Facebook and Google and The New York Times and the like for darn near everything.

Now here we are in 2022 and, thankfully, I don't see the dying embers of a forgotten web lying around me. **Quite the contrary**‚ÄîI see a bigger backlash against proprietary platforms and closed content networks than I have in nearly a decade! News outlets are doubling down on paywalls and establishing vital relationships with readers directly using, you guessed it, the open web...and even‚Äî**gasp!**‚Äîemail newsletters.

As someone who came of age at the dawn of the web, and whose entire career was made possible by the open web, I am a fierce advocate for keeping the web vibrant, lively, diverse, free "as in speech", and completely and radically open. The greatness of the web, the sheer genius of it, is it's a content and application platform which allows _anyone_ to join in and participate‚Äîno gatekeepers, no approval processes, no commercial stipulations. The only "limits" are what is considered legal by local/national governments. There has never been and perhaps never will be anything else like the world-wide web in human history.

As a defender of this open technology, I am staunchly in favor of net neutrality and oppose any sort of "firewalls" at any level that blocks citizens from accessing and publishing the content they desire. While I approve of web services (news outlets, apps, etc.) that charge users directly for access (either one-time or via subscription), I am strongly against the deployment of aggressive targeting and analytics scripts, and I decry any attempts to invade user privacy and compromise data integrity and security. I believe it is the fundamental right of every computer user to have access to strong encryption and exist in relative anonymity online should they so choose.

I also encourage everyone to set up their own homepage on their own domain name‚Äîpreferably on a server you control. (Psst...[I can help you with that!](https://www.whitefusion.studio){:target="_blank"} It's my job!)

### Programmer & Designer

As a teenager in 1997, when most kids were trying to figure out how to skip class and go skateboarding, I was starting my own website design & development company.

It's all music's fault. Our Celtic band _Distant Oaks_ needed a website, and since I was the most adept at graphics design and general computer geekery, it seemed like a slam dunk. So I cobbled something rudimentary together, and then refined it, and refined it again...and then the inquiries started coming in. ‚ÄúHey, that‚Äôs a cool-looking website. Can you build one for me? Oh, and how much do you charge?‚Äù

_What? You‚Äôre going to **pay me** to build you a website? You're on!_

Eventually my interest in designing websites grew into an interest in building software applications, and over time I became proficient in setting up databases, spinning up Linux servers, and coding in a variety of programming languages. Over the past several years, my love of Ruby has caused me to settle on a career as a Ruby developer‚Äîutilizing the Rails framework as well as Bridgetown for website publishing (including this one)‚Äîand for most of this whole time I've been fortunate to be able to work as a freelancer. My business is called [Whitefusion](https://www.whitefusion.studio).

Beyond programming, I've always maintained a love for graphics design and typography, so I seek out projects where I can make a difference visually as well as at the code level. And if I have the opportunity to write and edit content also, so much the better!

### Sci-Fi Nerd

<p style="font-size:110%">

  <strong>Oops, this section‚Äôs a little out of date! üòÖ</strong>
</p>

I never really got into comics as a kid, but I've always had a thing for science fiction and was a big-time Trekkie growing up. (Captain Jean-Luc Picard continues to be an influential figure in my life!) Over the past decade or so, as sci-fi has taken over the world of movies and TV shows and online streaming services have exploded, I must admit I have gotten completely sucked into this universe of superheroes and spaceships.

I'm a **huge** fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and I consider _Doctor Strange_ to be one of my all-time favorite movies. I also love the "arrowverse" shows on The CW and am reasonably caught up on most of them. _Arrow_ is probably still my favorite of the bunch, although newcomer _Black Lightning_ has really been crushing it right out of the gate.

I've also been geeking out with the revitalization of the _Star Wars_ franchise, and the Jedi Council show on YouTube is what introduced me to the broader world of movie news and fandom. Hardly a day goes by without me tuning into hearing the latest from John Campea.

As of this writing, _Avengers: Infinity War_ is about to drop‚Äîthe culmination of the entire MCU to date‚Äîand I am wild with anticipation. It's a good time to be a geek.

### Let's Connect
