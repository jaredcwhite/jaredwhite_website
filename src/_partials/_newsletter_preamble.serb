<h2>Stay in the Loop</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom:2rem">Look, I get it. You already subscribe to too many newsletters. So much to keep up with. But guess what? I only send out a newsletter once a week. And if you‘re feeling curious, peruse the <strong><a href="{{ site.metadata.newsletter.url }}">{{ site.metadata.newsletter.name }}</a></strong> archive. You might find something that resonates with you! It’s a great way to stay current with what I’m publishing, and newsletter recipients <em>always</em> get some extra insight just for them. So what are you waiting for? Let’s roll!</p>
