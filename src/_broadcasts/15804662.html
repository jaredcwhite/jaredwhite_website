It&#x27;s the third (fourth?) incarnation of essentially my <a href="https://jaredwhite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog JaredWhite.com</a>&#x27;s companion newsletter‚Ä¶and over that time it&#x27;s been through many permutations of topical focuses.</p><p class="">Something I&#x27;ve started thinking about more recently is how I might reframe <strong>Creator Class</strong> back into a newsletter more specifically devoted to discussion of art, creativity, productivity (ugh, I hate that word, but y&#x27;know), and freelancing. But that would mean all the <em>very important</em> convos (ugh, I also hate that word! üòÇ) around timely tech topics like Generative AI and the Fediverse would need to‚Ä¶live elsewhere?</p><p class=""><em>So, my friends, that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve done!</em> Say hello to <a href="https://buttondown.email/theinternet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cycles Hyped No More</a>.</p><p class="">Before I continue describing this new newsletter: <strong>YOU WILL NEED TO MANUALLY GO SUBSCRIBE</strong> if you wish to receive new issues. I could have been a total jerk and just automatically dropped your email address into that subscriber list‚Ä¶but obviously I would never do that!</p><p class="">So again, just to be crystal clear: <strong>YOU WILL NEED TO GO SUBSCRIBE</strong> to <a href="https://buttondown.email/theinternet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cycles Hyped No More</a> yourself if you wish to continue receiving the type of tech topics I sometimes covered here for Creator Class. Got it? Great. üòä</p><hr style="margin-top:48px;margin-bottom:48px"/><p class="">Now‚Ä¶what this actually is.</p><p class="">First of all, <a href="https://buttondown.email/theinternet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cycles Hyped No More</a> is a companion newsletter to <a href="https://theinternet.review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Review</a>, my recently resurrected tech blog which first launched in 1997 (<em>no joke!</em>) and is once again alive &#x27;n&#x27; kickin&#x27;.</p><p class="">More importantly, as it says on the tin: <strong>Cycles Hyped No More</strong> takes a critical look at ‚Äúhype cycles‚Äù and the ways Big Tech attempts to steer public discourse towards its own financial goals and away from grassroots development of person-centered tech. Plus a dash of micromobility and a sprinkling of open social Web (aka the Fediverse). <strong>The nerd version of Build Back Better!</strong></p><p class="">Yeah, as I keep saying‚Äîand this is by no means hyperbole‚Äîwe are now in the process of rearchitecting the Internet. And by ‚Äúwe‚Äù, I mean supporters and developers of the Fediverse (aka ActivityPub and adjacent open protocols) who very earnestly believe this is the <em>last, best hope</em> for a sustainable, independent, creator-led Web. I mean this very sincerely: if the Fediverse fails, we&#x27;re done for. The Internet will be completely taken over by a tiny number of large conglomerates who are more than happy to allow AI slop, crappy ads, and ever-increasing ‚Äúenshittification‚Äù to dominate ALL online spaces. And by all, <strong>I quite literally mean all.</strong> I hope you&#x27;ll agree this is unacceptable. Imagine a world where every physical retailer is owned by Walmart or Target, and every coffee shop is owned by Starbucks or Dunkin&#x27;. Seriously. We&#x27;re facing that exact hellscape scenario on the Web‚Ä¶<em>unless we do something about it.</em></p><p class="">So that&#x27;s one major aspect of Cycles Hyped No More: <strong>to cover the ongoing rebuilding of the Internet</strong>, as well as the alarming attempts of the Silicon Valley VC-fueled hype machines to interfere with this effort.</p><p class="">Another aspect is the intersection of (actually good!) new tech and <strong>urbanism</strong>. It&#x27;s not a stretch to say that micromobility vehicles powered by the latest generation of battery, motor, and computer gadgetry, along with regular ol&#x27; mechanical vehicles (aka bicycles primarily) plus a renewed focus on mass transit, are <strong>rapidly transforming cities here in North America and in many places around the world</strong>. Even as electric cars become more of an accepted norm and are viewed as the path forward away from fossil fuels, many people and even municipalities are questioning if we really do simply need more automobiles which happen to be electric, or if we instead need multimodal transport baked into the very fabric of urban planning. (<em>YES!</em>)</p><p class=""><strong>So there you have it.</strong> I think you&#x27;ll agree those sorts of topics would overwhelm other sorts of ‚Äútouchy-feely‚Äù creative discussions we want to keep having here on Creator Class, and that&#x27;s why I would LOVE for you to subscribe to <a href="https://buttondown.email/theinternet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cycles Hyped No More</a>.</p><p class="">Thank you, and as always, <em>please reply to this email </em>with your feedback and suggestions! I always love hearing from folks who have been impacted by my work, in any respect.</p><p class="">Best,</p><p class="">Jared</p><p class="">‚Äã</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
