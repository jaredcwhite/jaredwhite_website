This is my first issue going out solely to <a href="https://plus.intuitivefuture.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuitive+</a> subscribers. I wanted to share an update on how the launch went last week, but also some context on <em>just how crazy life can be</em>.</p><p class="">Soâ€¦I&#x27;ll be perfectly honest. I&#x27;ve gone through so many rounds of &quot;make a thing you&#x27;re really excited about, put it out on the internet, andâ€¦crickets!&quot; over the years, I had very little in the way concrete expectations. Like with most things I&#x27;ve done, my bar for &quot;success&quot; was anything meaningfully a cut above &quot;wow, sure feels like THAT was a complete waste of my time!&quot;</p><p class="">Well I&#x27;m happy to report that not only has the launch NOT been a waste of time, it really has been very cool! Seeing new signups on a nearly daily basis is thrilling, and hearing back from people who have taken the CSS course over at The Spicy Web has been nothing short of gratifying. I&#x27;m behind on a laundry list of improvements, but even getting <em>any</em> feedback on ways I might smooth out the signup process or other aspects of the learning experience is very welcome.</p><p class="">The best feedback I&#x27;ve gotten is along the lines of &quot;I love how you&#x27;ve set everything upâ€”I wish I&#x27;d thought of this a long time ago!&quot; Hearing that was an exciting confirmation that decisions I made as a creator quite some time ago in a vacuum are now being proven out in the cold light of dayâ€”and when you&#x27;re an indie, that&#x27;s rad indeed.</p><p style="text-align:center" class=""><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="color:#ef5823"><strong>AND YETâ€¦</strong></span></span></p><p class="">I&#x27;m writing this having just come off <em>THE WEEK FROM HELL</em>. Almost everything which <em>could</em> go wrong in my personal life did. ðŸ˜¥ Getting stranded on the side of the road because my car&#x27;s electrical system simply died en route was the <em>least</em> stressful thing which happened. Eventually it got to the point where every few hours my emails &amp; messages was cycling through:</p><ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span>BAD NEWS</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Yay, a new signup!</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>BAD NEWS</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Yay, somebody is excited about a fun CSS thing!</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>MORE BAD NEWSâ€¦<em>sucks to be you!</em></span></li></ul><p class="">I&#x27;m not quite yet out of the woods even now, but there&#x27;s reason to believe the worst is over. And at the very least, my car has a pep in its step once again! ðŸ¤ª</p><p class="">Maybe some day I&#x27;ll look back at this time with a wry grin and be all &quot;yeah, remember that October in 2023 when one week I launched Intuitive+ and The Spicy Web Courses, and the next week everything went to shit? That was a hell of a thing!&quot;</p><p class="">Maybe.</p><p class="">â€‹</p><hr style="margin-top:48px;margin-bottom:48px"/><p class="">At any rate, I&#x27;m super-duper excited to be getting back to full steam ahead on <strong>Creator Class</strong>. I hope you&#x27;re encouraged to keep going with the creative projects you really care about, <em>even if everything is temporarily nuts for you too</em>. There&#x27;s always light at the end of the tunnel. Just keep your eyes open.</p><p class="">Let me know what you&#x27;d love to hear about in future episodes of the newsletter! Simply reply to this email. Your feedback is always welcome.</p><p class=""><em>Cheers,<br/>Jared</em></p></div>
