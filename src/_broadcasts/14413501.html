  Welp, I spent most of this month (February 2024) very very sick ü§í ‚Ä¶<a
    href="https://jaredwhite.com/20240219/feb-2024-go-to-hell"
    >you can hear a bit about it here</a
  >
  but mostly some things I&#x27;m grateful for even in the middle of the mess.
</p>
<p>
  What I <em>was</em> able to get out of this less-than-stellar time period
  spent convalescing is even <em>more</em> resolve around the kinds of projects,
  topics, and genres I want to focus on‚Äîand more to the point,
  <em>what I intentionally don&#x27;t want to focus on</em>. To a certain
  extent, that&#x27;s what really matters over the long run: all the proverbial
  &quot;things you say no to, in order to say yes to the things which are most
  essential&quot;. But I think we tend to consider that mindset when it comes to
  creative decision-making (<em>yes</em> to this feature, <em>no</em> to that
  plot element, <em>yes</em> to this video concept, <em>no</em> to that article
  subject), and not as much when it comes to <strong>ethics</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Something I truly appreciated recently when watching a video by John Campea, a
  well-known YouTube commentator on entertainment news around film &amp; TV, was
  his assertion that he doesn&#x27;t publish &quot;reaction videos&quot; related
  to other YouTubers. In other words, you won&#x27;t find him jumping on some
  hot <em>very online</em> topic of the day and recording clickbait-y ‚Äú<strong
    >you&#x27;ll never BELIEVE what they said about THIS!</strong
  >‚Äù noise. He prefers to stick to his lane of simply offering analysis and
  perspective on entertainment news and releases along with his crew, and
  responding to listener comments‚Äîsomething he&#x27;s been doing literally for
  decades now.
</p>
<p>
  I think it&#x27;s <strong>vitally important</strong> to get very, very clear
  about what you are <em>and are not </em>willing to do as a content creator.
  This has become more important than ever as the vast majority of online
  content platforms today are actively user-hostile, filled with deceptive ads
  and dark UX patterns, and riddled with grifts, radicalized voices,
  misinformation, and fakery. It&#x27;s not enough merely to imagine you&#x27;re
  a decent person and not trying to harm anyone. In certain cases,
  <strong
    >simply showing up is implicitly lending your endorsement of the most vile
    stuff.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  Look, I&#x27;m not here to shame you into either doing or avoiding certain
  behaviors in your pursuit of being a content creator‚Äîthat&#x27;s not my role!
  I&#x27;m simply encouraging you to think deeply about what you are or are not
  willing to do ethically and socially as you engage in this space. What are the
  lines you will never cross? What will happen when you&#x27;re tempted to cross
  them? What will you do instead? What kind of support system do you have around
  you? What have you communicated with your audience, your fans, so that they
  understand your position on issues like this and can trust your future
  judgement?
</p>
<p>
  As this newsletter title goes, what you <em>won&#x27;t do</em> under any
  circumstances has the power to establish a healthy platform upon which you can
  build what you <em>will do </em>in your career. I didn&#x27;t always think in
  these terms‚Ä¶in the earlier days of using the internet, I just blithely assumed
  all independent creators online were all in the same boat together and making
  cool shit. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s just not the case anymore. Yes, there
  are still awesome independent creators making cool shit (hopefully that&#x27;s
  you!), but all too often they&#x27;re algorithmically intertwined with
  less-than-savory actors and people whose desire for fame and business success
  trumps any sort of real commitment to considerate ethical behavior.
</p>
<p>
  I <strong>hate </strong>that feeling when I have to unsubscribe from a
  creator, or refrain from recommending certain sources of information, simply
  because I can no longer trust they&#x27;re operating with good judgement based
  on the reality of today&#x27;s ‚Äúenshittified‚Äù digital landscape. In an ideal
  world, we&#x27;d all just get along, man. <em>Groovy groovy</em>. ‚úåÔ∏è But we
  don&#x27;t live in an ideal world. And so we&#x27;re forced to get defensive
  and practice ‚Äúsafe publishing and networking‚Äù online.
</p>
<p>
  Listen, nobody&#x27;s perfect! I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll still get things wrong
  now and again. But I feel satisfied in the knowledge I&#x27;m not blind to
  these matters, and I&#x27;m making an effort to call a spade a spade. And I
  absolutely love it when I see other creators doing that too. More power to
  ‚Äôem!

  and define your comfort levels around how you conduct yourself as a content
