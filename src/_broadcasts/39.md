title: Breaking Out of Loops

**Oh, the things we tell ourselves.** _Over and over and over again._

* It's all been for nothing.
* Things are going downhill again just as they always have before.
* Why did I think this time things would be different?
* LOL, nobody cares. Shocker.
* This will never get better.
* Everyone else has this all figured out. Everyone but me.
* Welp, I failed. And I'll fail again. I always fail…

These loops we fall into—particularly when we're tired, stressed, or lonely—are just that. Loops. Patterns. Ruts in our synapses. Familiar, certainly. But ultimately **meaningless**.

Because, you see, the problem with loops is they never offer any real solutions, any off-ramps. They are simply brick walls. Even if one might appear to be a route to somewhere, it's like in the old Looney Tunes cartoons: as soon as you try to drive into that tunnel, **_KERSPLAT!_** You're a pancake slowly sliding down the paint.

I am getting better (aka quicker) at snapping out of my _woe-is-me_ loops. Sometimes **I'll literally snap my fingers** loudly on either side of my head and audibly tell myself _Snap out of it!_ On occasion, I've even been known to slap my cheeks!

**(Take that, Captain Kirk!)**

The truth I've come to learn over the years is that self-pity is truly an indulgence. And it's a luxury I simply cannot afford. **I've come too far** to turn back now just because it's easier to play the sad trombone than it is to get up and _go get some real shit done_.

Put another way, **every second I waste feeling sorry for myself** is a second I could have spent improving myself instead…perhaps focused on genuine rest & mediation so I'm better prepared for the "fight" ahead.

I well understand that, in the moment when you've fallen into that depressive state, it _feels_ like you can never again gain your mojo. But that too is an illusion, and I've learned I can tell myself that. I can say to myself "you may feel like shit today—perhaps even for logical reasons—but you'll feel **awesome** in a day or two. Just you wait!"

And guess what? 98.375% of the time, that's absolutely true! (It's a totally scientific statistic, dontchaknow.)

So here's to turning away from that "stinkin' thinkin'" and breaking out of our loops. It doesn't mean falling prey to _hustle culture_ or going all _woo-hoo_ with affirmations or whatever. I'm simply telling you that getting back into your **flow state** is often easier than you realize. When you cultivate a daily habit of _believing_ that your mindful intention will jumpstart your capacity to rise to creative excellence, **genuine change will materialize into existence**. ✌️

### News About Newsletters

So if you're reading this email and wondering why things look a bit different, it's because I've switched from ConvertKit (now just Kit) to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com). I've been talking about this for a while now in other contexts, but the TL;DR is that _all_ of my newsletters are now running off of Buttondown, which is truly a **fantastic platform** for writers.

As a side effect of these changes, I am now pleased to inform you that all of my newsletters are now part of **[Intuitive+](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com)**. This newsletter (**Creator Class** of course), as well as **Cycles Hyped No More**, **Fullstack Ruby**, and **That HTML Blog**, all have joined my subscription platform. This means I'll be sending out _bonus issues_ every month to **Intuitive+** members! And frankly I'll be a lot more motivated to stay consistent even with the "free" issues since it'll all be adding value to the platform.

[I hope you choose to **support me**](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com/) as an independent writer and educator! 😊 It's been a \*long time\* coming, and I couldn't be more excited to really, _really_, **really** give this career a go.

✉️ [Please let me know](mailto:jared@jaredwhite.com) what you'd like to see in future installments of **Creator Class**! I want to make this the _very best_ source of motivation, raw grit, and actionable insights to help you stay true to your creative journey.

_Cheers,_  
_Jared_
