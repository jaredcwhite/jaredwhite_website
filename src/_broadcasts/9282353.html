    Two months later, I&#x27;m back to writing a newsletter.
    <em><strong>Oops!</strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>
    In case you forgot entirely who this Jared guy is,
    <strong>Hi! I live in Portland, Oregon.</strong> I&#x27;m a web developer by
    trade, and I like to think about and talk about content creation, ethics in
    technology, freelancing and soloprenurship, spirituality, and solo travel.
    My website is at
    <a href="https://jaredwhite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >jaredwhite.com</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what happened? Well,
    <a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >I&#x27;ve recorded a new episode</a
    >
    of my apparently resurrected podcast <strong>Fresh Fusion</strong> all about
    it. Without repeating beat by beat what&#x27;s in the episode, let me just
    riff off the ending briefly.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#x27;m about to start vlogging again for
    <a

    >
    on YouTube, but it&#x27;s worth discussing why I had stopped previously.
    Yes, in many respects I had stopped due to other time commitments and
    pressing matters, but that&#x27;s not the <em>whole reason</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Truth be told,
    <strong>I struggled a lot earlier this year with self-esteem issues</strong
    >, both emotionally and physically. In a way, I didn&#x27;t <em>want</em> to
    be on camera because I didn&#x27;t like how I looked on camera. I
    wasn&#x27;t sure if I could feel comfortable with my in-person
    &quot;vibe&quot; so to speak. I guess you could call it an
    <em>identity crisis</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A by-product of the divorce? Getting older? Gaining weight? A very damp and
    dismal spring in Portland this year, leading me to feel SAD (Seasonal
    Affective Disorder)? An increasing dissatisfaction concerning my living
    quarters (especially knowing I would need to move soon anyway)?
  </p>
  <p><strong>Likely all of the above combined together.</strong> ðŸ˜­</p>
  <p>
    But now that I&#x27;ve moved (still within Portland city center, BTW),
    it&#x27;s sunny and warm (if not downright <em>HOT!</em>), and I&#x27;m able
    to be much more active outdoors, my outlook on life feels quite different.
    Nowâ€”rather than vlogging feeling like a burden, or embarassing in some
    wayâ€”I&#x27;m feeling like reaching for my camera is actually
    <em>helping</em> my mood and is something I can look forward to on a daily
    basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    It&#x27;ll likely be a week or two before the first episode of this new era
    comes out, as I&#x27;m trying to amass a backlog of footage before
    publishing anything.
    <em>Yes, I&#x27;m doing things the right way this time.</em> ðŸ˜…
  </p>
  <p>
    So until thenâ€¦I hope you&#x27;re doing well and staying cool in this very,
    very hot summer, and I look forward to revealing more about my life and my
    values on camera and beyond (<a

    <strong>Creator Class </strong>and sticking with me this far!
