<p style="text-align:center" class=""><strong>The future is here! And it&#x27;s, uh‚Ä¶not great.</strong> üòï</p>

<p class="">In an age where increasingly everything seems fake, and you can barely tell the <em>generated</em> from the <em>created</em> at first glance, the fact that YOU <strong>are in fact the real deal</strong> is <em>incredibly</em> valuable.</p><p class="">It may not seem like that right away. You may feel a sense of dread that the quality work you put your body and soul into day in and day out is in the process of being swept away, flooded out‚Äîdestroyed in a tsunami of AI-generated content farms and bot-fluencers and flashy automated tools sold by unscrupulous startups.</p><p class="">But this is a temporary arrangement. People‚Äîmost people I reckon‚Äîdon&#x27;t actually desire to form emotional attachments and &quot;engage&quot; with bots. Once the novelty wears off, there&#x27;s a craving for something legitimate. <em>Something real</em>.</p><p class="">Every time I see a headline like this:<br/>‚Äã<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2023/11/24/this-ai-generated-influencer-can-pull-in-10000-euros-a-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This AI-Generated Influencer Can Pull In Almost $11,000 A Month</a>‚Äã</p><p class="">I read it like this:<br/>‚Äã<em>This AI-Generated Influencer Is A Fleeting Fad, And Soon It Will Be Pulling In Almost $0 A Month</em>. üòÇ</p><p class="">Companies, marketers, and &quot;influencers&quot; may think they can just get away with peddling fake garbage to make a quick buck, but their time will soon be over. We read stories like these:<br/>‚Äã</p><ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span>‚Äã<a href="https://www.404media.co/devternity-fake-speakers-eduard-sizovs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tech Conference Collapses After Organizer Admits to Making Fake ‚ÄòAuto-Generated‚Äô Female Speaker</a>‚Äã</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>‚Äã<a href="https://www.404media.co/coding-unicorn-instagram-julia-kirsina-devternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Male Tech Conference Founder Is Behind Popular Woman Coding Influencer Account</a>‚Äã</span></li></ul><p class="">‚Äã<br/>And all I can think of is: <em>Dude, you built your house on sand. Don&#x27;t be surprised when it all crumbles to dust</em>.</p><p class="">Now here&#x27;s an important point to keep in mind. <strong>Fake art is nothing new</strong>. We&#x27;ve been dealing with this for far longer than AI. Ghostwriters. Songwriters barely credited in the fine print. Photoshop jobs run amuck. Stupid trendy Instagram travel shots. Auto-Tune. Heck, go all the way back to the Middle Ages and you have paintings by some famous artist which were really painted by students of the artist. They&#x27;d do most of the work, and the master painter would take all the credit.</p><p class=""><em>Yay Humans?</em></p><p class="">But with everything going on right now, we need to wake the fuck up. It&#x27;s time to intentionally move <strong>even farther away</strong> from the <em>laissez-faire</em> fakery of the past.</p><p class="">Give us your absolute raw, unfiltered, <strong>human</strong> talent‚Äîwarts and all. Too many freckles on your left cheek? Great! Your voice warbled a bit on that otherwise moving take? Leave it in! Too many spelling mistakes in your blog post? Who cares! (er, well maybe let&#x27;s care about that‚Ä¶ üòÖ)</p><p class=""><em>Wabi-Sabi all the things!</em></p><p class="">We are in desperate need of real authenticity. The genuine article. Creativity put forth by <strong>people who care</strong>.<br/>‚Äã</p><p style="text-align:center" class="">In <a href="https://xeiaso.net//blog/birth-death-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The birth &amp; death of search engine optimization</a>, Xe Iaso writes:</p><p style="text-align:center" class=""><em>We are surrounded by information and nearly none of it is useful. Most of it is poorly attempting to sell us something. It is an infinite arms race that is destroying the very tools that we use to learn about observable reality.</em></p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class="">And that&#x27;s the real danger of the &quot;Age of AI&quot;‚Äînot that some brainiac artificial lifeform will emerge, take over the military, and destroy mankind. We need not fear The Terminator. We&#x27;re clearly adept at being our own worst enemy.</p><p class="">My fear is that we will destroy ourselves because lies and sheer nonsense is more profitable.</p><p class=""><em>But here&#x27;s the thing about capitalism.</em> When everyone jumps aboard Trend A and it eventually becomes totally commodified, you can start Countertrend B and suddenly <em>that</em> is what is truly valuable. Luxury. Boutique.</p><p class="">I&#x27;m proposing exactly that: a <em>radical</em> stance on human authenticity. Don&#x27;t just be wary of AI tooling, content automation, and the Photoshopization of reality. <strong>Avoid it completely.</strong></p><p class="">Promote the digital equivalent of &quot;handmade&quot;. Slow down. Focus on the work that really matters. Make it quirky, unique. Put a stamp on it. &quot;I made this.&quot; Look at what everyone else is doing in this fruitless AI arms race and <strong>do the opposite</strong>.</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class="">I look forward to being the highest-paid programmer in the room when everyone else has forgotten (or never learned!) how to program because GitHub Copilot stole people&#x27;s craft away from them, and now (surprise, surprise!) <em>somebody&#x27;s gotta figure out how to keep the trains running on time</em>.</p><p class="">I predict there will eventually be &quot;digital safe spaces&quot; which only allow <strong>guaranteed</strong> human-sourced and fact-checked content in. Many communities which only function properly when truth is prioritized are currently reeling from the onslaught of all this fake garbage. <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/23/11/27/1420214/there-is-a-scientific-fraud-epidemic?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;There is a Scientific Fraud Epidemic&quot;</a> and it&#x27;s so bad individual scientists funded by Patreon supporters have taken it upon themselves to hunt down and flag problem data.</p><p class="">Don&#x27;t give into the lie that we live in a &quot;post-truth&quot; world. Truth, art, authenticity, and meaning are more important than ever‚Äîand in a world where there&#x27;s a flood of‚Ä¶the other stuff‚Ä¶these things become more valuable than ever.</p><p class="">Your 100% authenticity is your most valuable asset. <strong>Don&#x27;t give up the fight.</strong></p><p class=""><strong>‚Äã</strong></p><p class="">Bonus read: <a href="https://jenniferplusplus.com/losing-the-imitation-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loosing the imitation game</a> by Jennifer Moore (mostly concerning software development but you can extrapolate the points out to any technical field of endeavor.)</p><p class="">‚Äã</p>

<h3>What Else I&#x27;ve Been Up To</h3>

<p class="">üéôÔ∏è As I mentioned on Fresh Fusion podcast episode <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/105/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">105: Sam Altman is Gone! Er, Back!</a> my November was absolutely bananas. I hate to sound so cagey, but I have to maintain the privacy of my family. It&#x27;s been a difficult time for me, and next month isn&#x27;t looking a whole lot better üò≠, but I definitely appreciate the structure of work and to that end continuing to write and record podcasts has been truly rewarding.</p><p class="">üòå I&#x27;m really proud of the essay I published called <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/barbie-mindfulness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mindfulness Meditation and the Enlightenment of Barbie</a>. As the summary states, I have rarely if ever seen the form of meditation I practice properly depicted on-screen. Finding this incredible and moving moment nestled inside of a blockbuster pop culture movie about plastic dolls was certainly surprising and definitely welcome.</p><p class="">üõ¥ And finally, <a href="https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite/111432817377413012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a popular toot I posted on Mastodon</a> all about micromobility. I&#x27;ve been beating this drum for a while and will continue to beat it: the next big tech-driven societal revolution after the smartphone will not be AI, nor will it be self-driving cars. It will be the transformation in transportation and urban environments afforded by micromobiles: e-bikes, e-scooters, and a myriad of devices which look like a cross between an e-bike and a small car. I&#x27;m also willing to lump AR glasses into this. Stuff like Apple Vision Pro looks neat, but I&#x27;m not really interested in sitting at my desk all day wearing a Vision Pro. However, using something more portable and lightweight out in the real world which provides a location-specific digital overlay? <em>Now you&#x27;re talking.</em></p>
