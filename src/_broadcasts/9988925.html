<p>Today&#x27;s newsletter will be short, as I am neck-deep in trying to prepare for <a
    href="https://bridgetownconf.rocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BridgetownConf 2022</a> (an online
  one-day conference for Ruby-based web developers). I&#x27;ve never put on a conference before, even if it&#x27;s
  essentially just an extended Zoom meetup, so needless to say I&#x27;m a <em>wee bit </em>nervous about the whole thing
  and wondering if I can pull it off. Hopefully so, because my intention is to host an increasing number of online
  meetups in the future around various programming topics.</p>

<p>üéπüéõÔ∏è The main <strong>blogging</strong> endeavor I have going on right now is a rather fun little project I&#x27;ve
  wanted to kick off for quite some times. From now until the end of the year, every day <a
    href="https://www.yarred.com/tangerine-dream-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I&#x27;m posting a
    mini-essay/review on a particular &quot;Best Of&quot; selection</a> from my favorite electronic music group
  <strong>Tangerine Dream</strong>. Not everyone has heard of TD‚Äîor perhaps only remember them in passing from a time
  long ago (they&#x27;ve been around for 50+ years ‚ÄºÔ∏è). But I can guarantee that if you are at all a fan of electronic
  music and synthesizers, your musical heroes no doubt are familiar with their work. <a
    href="https://www.yarred.com/tangerine-dream-2022/10/17/tangram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I
    elaborate a little bit on my obsession for the band here</a> in the first installment featuring <em>Tangram</em>.
  (And in case it&#x27;s not obvious, all these posts are going up on the website for my musical alter-ego
  <strong>Yarred</strong>.)</p>

<p>üìπ In other news, <a
    href="https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20221018/seattle-vlog-japanese-garden-for-free-lake-sammamish" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">the second episode in my latest vlog series</a> about visiting Seattle and the Puget Sound
  area is now available. I had a great time at the southside beach of Lake Sammamish as well as exploring the
  <strong>Kubota Japanese Garden</strong>‚Äîwhich astonishingly is free admission!</p>

  <p><em>&#x27;Till next time,<br />Jared</em></p>
