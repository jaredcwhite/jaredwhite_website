<p class="">Greetings, past and new <strong><em>Creator Class</em></strong> subscribers! In <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class/2023-08-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Issue 31</a>, I talked about how I was temporarily pausing work on this newsletter and my <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fresh Fusion</a> podcast so that I could focus on getting <strong>Intuitive+</strong> off the ground.</p><p class="">Well, that day is here at last! <a href="https://plus.intuitivefuture.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Say Hello to Intuitive+</a>.</p><p class="">A few of you are members already, which is simply fantastic! <strong>Welcome</strong>. üëã Most of you are just finding out about this, so let me explain a bit about what&#x27;s going on.</p><p class="">I just launched an educational course for web developers over at my site <em><strong>The Spicy Web</strong></em>, called <a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev/css-nouveau" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Nouveau</a>. If you&#x27;re in that industry, I hope you&#x27;ll check it out! If not, no worries. The point is, that course and future materials comprise simply one aspect of the total benefits of becoming an <strong>Intuitive+</strong> subscriber.</p><p class="">The other benefits members enjoy include getting a lot more in-depth content through this newsletter, as well as through the <em><strong>Fresh Fusion</strong></em> podcast. On <a href="https://plus.intuitivefuture.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuitive+</a>, you can add the &quot;Plus&quot; version of the podcast to your podcast player of choice with a special feed URL. Every episode going forward, I&#x27;ll be adding a special Plus segment which is <em>only</em> available to members of Intuitive+. </p><p class="">In addition, you can subscribe to a <em>bonus edition</em> of <em><strong>Creator Class</strong></em> which will offer more in-depth, actionable educational material around growing and promoting yourself as a content creator. Hey, what if you don&#x27;t really think of yourself as a &quot;content creator&quot;? Well you might want to reexamine that! Are you active on social media, or writing, or making videos, or just generally trying to get the word out about a cause or art or politics or anything else you <em>deeply</em> care about? Congratulations, you&#x27;re a content creator! <strong>This newsletter is for you</strong>.</p><p class="">What if you don&#x27;t want to join <strong>Intuitive+</strong>? No sweat, you&#x27;ll still receive issues of <em><strong>Creator Class</strong></em> and you can still listen to <em><strong>Fresh Fusion</strong></em>.  But just know that you won&#x27;t be getting my best, clearest, and most <em>insightful</em> analysis of &quot;the business, the art, the ethics of content creation on the open web and the fediverse&quot; or &quot;the challenges and rewards of being an indie content creator building an audience one connection at a time.&quot;</p><p class="">I have put my heart and soul into launching <a href="https://plus.intuitivefuture.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuitive+</a>, and this is only the beginning. ‚ò∫Ô∏è I sincerely hope you&#x27;ll decide to join me in this endeavor. Let&#x27;s continue to build this amazing community of like-minded individuals who believe in a better, healthier, and more indie-powered future of the internet.</p><p class=""><em>Cheers,<br/>Jared</em></p>
