<p class="">
  They say write what you know, so as I listen to
  <em>The Policy of Truth</em> by one of my favorite New Wave synth-pop bands,
  Depeche Mode, it&#x27;s time to talk about‚Ä¶well,
  <strong>the policy of truth</strong>. üòÅ
</p>
<p class="">
  It feels like the era we&#x27;re now in has never presented such a clear
  contrast between the actors who are <strong>genuinely trying</strong> to offer
  products, services, art, news, and technologies which are beneficial for the
  majority of people (and if not <em>great</em> for the environment, at least
  don&#x27;t overtly pose a grave threat to the health of our planet)
  and‚Ä¶whatever the fuck the opposite of that is. <em>You know who they are.</em>
</p>
<p class=""><strong>The grifters.</strong></p>
<p class=""><strong>The hustlebros.</strong></p>
<p class=""><strong>The gaslighting bullshitters.</strong></p>
<p class=""><strong>The CEOs of rapidly-corroding brands.</strong></p>
<p class="">
  <strong>The smug red-pilled alt-right paleolibertarians.</strong>
</p>
<p class="">
  Never in my life (and as much as I hate to admit it, it&#x27;s a life where
  <em>I still vividly remember</em> the dawn of the World-Wide Web and the
  thrill of a 56K modem opening up a portal to cyberspace!) can I recall a time
  of such <strong>intentional cautiousness</strong> being <em>required</em> for
  me to participate in online commerce and discourse so as to feel even remotely
  ethically sound in my actions.
</p>
<p class="">
  <strong>Believe me</strong>, it&#x27;s supremely frustrating,
  <em>tiring</em> to have to ask questions on a daily basis like:
</p>
<p class="">‚û°Ô∏è Is this art I&#x27;m consuming compromising my moral values?</p>
<p class="">
  ‚û°Ô∏è Is this company I&#x27;m spending money on (or allowing to &quot;sell
  me&quot; for ad revenue) simply going to make me feel like dogshit later on?
</p>
<p class="">
  ‚û°Ô∏è Are the leaders behind this technology I&#x27;m using seemingly plotting to
  erode trust in civil society, pitting minorities against each other in order
  maintain the status quo for the privileged, and spouting sheer nonsense
  wrapped up in the cynical guise of &quot;I&#x27;m just asking questions, do
  your own research&quot;?!
</p>
<p class="">
  I know I know, <em>heady topics</em> for a casual email newsletter issue. But
  as a creator, and someone who talks to creators all the time,
  <strong>we MUST take a clear stance on the vital issues of the day</strong>.
  The very nature of truth is at stake, and the entire Internet is quite
  literally in danger of being overrun by misinformation, disinformation, and
  artificially-generated bytes devoid of any meaning.
</p>
<p class="">
  Sounds frightening! <strong>And yet I remain optimistic</strong>. üëê I
  actually believe there&#x27;s a growing and influential movement‚Äîlargely
  centered in and around the Fediverse‚Äîmade up of people with a vision for a
  better Web: a network which rewards truly good content and minimizes the reach
  of bad actors, a decentralized platform where ethical services can be built
  outside the confines of unsustainable hypergrowth capitalism.
</p>
<p class="">
  I meet people all the time on Mastodon, Threads (yes I know, somehow Meta
  hasn&#x27;t figured out how to fuck it up quite yet!), and other online
  communities who are genuinely, earnestly working towards a brighter future.
  These creators, developers, and journalists give me hope.
  <strong>We need more of them. We need </strong><em><strong>you!</strong></em>
</p>
<p class="">
  As I always say about blogging (the best time to have started a blog was
  yesterday, the second-best time is now), the second-best time to join the
  Fediverse is <strong>now</strong>. If you&#x27;ve only dipped a toe into open
  social networking, I encourage you to throw caution to the wind and jump in
  headfirst! We are currently witnessing a Cambrian explosion in the number of
  people, platforms, and tools participating in this new version of the
  Internet, and we have a twice-in-a-lifetime opportunity (the first time was in
  the early 90s!) to shape the next era of digital.
