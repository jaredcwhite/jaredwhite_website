One day working on some particular project is like the sky has parted, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and angels are dancing on the clouds playing melodious tunes on gold harps. The next day, it&#x27;s like‚Ä¶none of that. <em>At all.</em></p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class="">I think a lot of popular takes you&#x27;ll find out there (go ahead, search &quot;burnout&quot; on DuckDuckGo) on the &quot;what&quot; and the &quot;why&quot; and the &quot;how to fix&quot; are much more generalized, like burnout is some sort of all-encompassing psychological and physiological condition.</p><p class="">As a creator, I often experience burnout in far more targeted ways (<a href="https://www.bridgetownrb.com/future/road-to-bridgetown-2.0-escaping-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here&#x27;s a recent example!</a>). It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m dealing with general burnout (aka some sort of crippling <em>woe is me!</em> scenario), but it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m dealing with it on <em>this one project</em> or <em>that one artform</em> or <em>this one cultural niche</em>.</p><p class=""><strong>Y&#x27;know what I&#x27;m saying?</strong></p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class="">Now maybe you <em>are</em> experiencing general burnout right now, in which case I&#x27;m very sorry to hear that and hope you can talk with some trusted friends or a therapist about what you&#x27;re going through. But if you&#x27;re in more of a narrow creative funk‚Äîas happens with me not infrequently‚Äîhere are some of the ways I&#x27;ve dealt with it.</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><h3 class=""><span style="font-size:18px">Temporarily Quit</span></h3><p class="">If at all possible (and perhaps this will be challenging if you have a regular following and they&#x27;re expecting consistent updates), just stop what you&#x27;re doing. Rather than push through the burnout by white-knuckling it and gritting your teeth, take a step back. And I don&#x27;t mean for a few days, I mean for a substantial period of time. Weeks, if not months.</p><p class="">Believe me, <strong>I know how hard this is</strong>. You&#x27;ll go through all sorts of feelings of guilt, regret, confusion, and perhaps even self-loathing. You&#x27;re letting everyone down! Worse, you&#x27;re letting yourself down. You&#x27;re a screwup. üò´</p><p class=""><em><strong>NO!</strong></em></p><p class="">Get those terrible thoughts out of your head. You&#x27;re taking a break <em>for</em> your audience. You&#x27;re taking a break <em>for</em> yourself. This is a positive step forward, a healthy step forward. It&#x27;s not a bad thing. <strong>It&#x27;s a good thing.</strong> You need to regroup. You need to recharge. You&#x27;ll ultimately do better work because of it. üòå</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><h3 class=""><span style="font-size:18px">Remember Why You Got Into This</span></h3><p class="">Now that you&#x27;re on a break, you can slowly begin to reconnect with the reasons why you got into this space in the first place. Think back to those early days when you were <em>oh so excited</em> to be doing this. <em>What did it look like? How did it feel? What was it you hoped to accomplish?</em></p><p class="">Nostalgia can be dangerous as a creative, because you start to fixate on how good it ‚Äúwas‚Äù, rather than on how good it ‚Äúwill be‚Äù‚Ä¶but a little bit of nostalgia when you&#x27;re on a creative break can be very productive. It allows you to compare the imagined trajectory of your past self with the reality of where you are now‚Ä¶which leads directly into my next point.</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><h3 class=""><span style="font-size:18px">Take Bold Steps to Course Correct</span></h3><p class="">As you take time off from your project, artform, and/or community, and you begin to recall what it originally was that got you so jazzed about doing what you&#x27;ve been doing, you may start to feel a huge degree of <em>cognitive dissonance</em>. Where you intended to go from the start, and where you ended up, might be far off the mark. This is a deeply uncomfortable feeling, but roll with it! <strong>Embrace it.</strong> You were already feeling this angst to a certain degree‚Äîwhich is what led you to your burnout in the first place!‚Äîso now&#x27;s your chance to face it head on and then <em><strong>DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.</strong></em> </p><p class="">Start writing down your thoughts‚Ä¶and don&#x27;t be surprised if this turns into a full-blown manifesto. Note that at this stage you&#x27;re not operating in the realm of the practical, you&#x27;re operating in the realm of the <strong>possible</strong>. So you can go a little nuts with the brainstorming and the dream journaling. Get clear on your <strong>values</strong>. Make sure you know in a deep-seated way what you actually <strong>want</strong>.</p><p class="">After a while you&#x27;ll probably see some patterns and key takeaways begin to emerge. Or‚Ä¶perhaps you&#x27;ll begin to realize what you had been working on ended up so off the mark, it&#x27;s time to start over in some way. Either away, at least you&#x27;re beginning to feel <strong>empowered</strong> at this point, as knowledge and understanding take hold, rather than disillusioned and scattered.</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><h3 class=""><span style="font-size:18px">Craft a Game Plan‚ÄîBut Ease into it Carefully</span></h3><p class="">Now that some time has passed and you&#x27;ve had the opportunity to distance yourself from the grind and recharge a bit, here comes the part where you can take all the wacky ideas and notes and journal entries and brainstorms and begin to tease out two things: a handful of <strong>Big Hairy Audacious Goals</strong> (BHAGs) which will motivate you over the long haul (aka your &quot;north star&quot; to guide future decision-making), and another handful of immediate <strong>Action Items</strong> to get you started on your course-corrected path.</p><p class=""><strong>HOWEVER</strong>, as much as you might have dropped everything rather suddenly at the start of this burnout-solving process, you&#x27;re going to want to jumpstart things <em>very slowly, carefully, and deliberately</em>. As much as you might be tempted to jump back into the deep end now that your energy and drive have returned, you&#x27;ll want to avoid the bad habits which led to burnout in the first place. Take it one step at a time, one day at a time. Find that &quot;new normal&quot; in terms of schedule, pace, and planning cycles. Be realistic about how much you can accomplish in the near-term. Don&#x27;t over-promise and then under-deliver, because that&#x27;s a sure-fire way of falling right back into the situation which resulted in your burnout in the first place.</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><h3 class=""><span style="font-size:18px">Know That This Will Happen All Over Again‚Ä¶Eventually</span></h3><p class="">I <em>hate</em> this part, but I&#x27;ve been through this enough times that I have to be honest with myself. I <em>will</em> burnout again down the road. If not about <em>this</em>, then about <em>that</em>. Burnout sounds like a bad word, a failing, a mistake‚Ä¶but I&#x27;ve come to realize it&#x27;s just part of the creative process. As I said at the beginning, you can&#x27;t have your highs without your lows. Just remember when you&#x27;re in the thick of the lows that this period of time is just as important as the times when you&#x27;re flying high and all is right with the world. <strong>This is the artistic process.</strong> You might not like it (ugh! I don&#x27;t! üòÖ), but it&#x27;s how the magic is made. ü™Ñ</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class=""><em>Are you experiencing burnout?</em> Or went through this very recently? <a href="mailto:jared@jaredwhite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I&#x27;d love to hear about it</a> and offer any encouragement or support I can. And let me know if you have any additional suggestions for how to make it through this process successfully.</p><p class=""><em>Cheers,<br/>Jared</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
