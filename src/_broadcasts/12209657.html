<p class="">I&#x27;ve begun to rewatch my favorite comedy show, <em>Portlandia</em> (<a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/what-its-like-to-live-in-portlandia">which I&#x27;ve written about previously</a>), and I&#x27;m listening to the commentary tracks for Season 1. Now of course I&#x27;m aware they go into these sketches with a fairly definite idea of what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish, but there&#x27;s certainly plenty of ad-libbing and improvisation going on, and they end up having to cut a lot of the footage down to get the best lines and takes and keep things tight.</p><p class="">I&#x27;ve never done theater or any sort of acting really, but I did <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/about#musician">perform on stage for years as a Celtic Folk musician</a> which encompassed a fair degree of improv. You could say it was rather akin to Jazz, as opposed to more classical or even certain pop genres that are more spelled out and rigid.</p><p class=""><strong>Learning to embrace &quot;the moment&quot; and be quick on your feet</strong>, ready to try out a new lick or go with someone else&#x27;s flow that they might be into at present, is a skill that&#x27;s served me well in a variety of other creative avenues. Whether I&#x27;m approaching a programming project, recording a podcast episode, cutting a new videoâ€”or even writing this very newsletter when in fact I didn&#x27;t know what topic I would be covering until I started writing it!â€”I&#x27;m not afraid to do improv. Sure, it can help to plan ahead, take down lots of notes, and engage in various other sorts of prep work. But there&#x27;s something to be said about learning to revel in <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/the-blank-slate">The Blank Slate</a>, to see that willingness to dive headfirst into uncharted creative waters as a benefit, not a curse.</p><p class="">As an exercise, I hereby challenge you to look over your To Do list or maybe even some past ideas left on the back burner, pick a small project that you&#x27;d been itching to tackle, and then try jumping into it as fast and loose as possible. Don&#x27;t overthink it, don&#x27;t plan ahead much, don&#x27;t really try to take it all apart inch by inch in order to come up with a &quot;game plan&quot;. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Just Do It!! Don&#x27;t let your dreams be dreams!</a> ðŸ˜‰</p><p class=""><em>Time to improv!</em></p>

<h3 class="">Across the Fediverse</h3>

<p class="">I know you&#x27;re all <em>sick to death</em> of hearing about Threads, so <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/98/">I recorded a podcast episode</a> where I talk about the talk about Threads. Yeah, you could say I&#x27;ve goneâ€¦Meta. ðŸ˜Ž</p><p class="">Seriously though, there are references to lots of interesting folks on Mastodon and beyond discussing the current zeitgeist of social media, so be sure to check that out.</p><p class="">I also published a video all about <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20230710/portland-vlog-lan-su-chinese-garden-for-fathers-day-wow">my awesome Father&#x27;s Day trip to Lan Su Chinese Garden in Portland</a> with my kids. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as we had fun making it!</p><p class="">By the way, I&#x27;m increasingly having fun using other fediverse networks apart from Mastodon, such as Pixelfed and Kbin (aka the &quot;threadiverse&quot;), so I hope to talk more about those experiences next and how they can compliment a strategy of Mastodon-first participation.</p>

<p class=""><em>Cheers,<br/>Jared</em></p>
