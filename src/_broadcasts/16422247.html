<p class="">One of the more fascinating aspects of working on <a href="https://theinternet.review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Review</a> reboot project was coming to grips with <em>just how many damn times I had started over from scratch</em> when it came to writing about technology online for the past ~30 years.</p><p class="">I literally had to draw diagrams and save many, many bookmarks from The Internet Archive&#x27;s <a href="https://theinternet.review/2013/05/10/thank-goodness-for-wayback-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a> just to keep track of all the different places my words had ended up (and subsequently forgotten) over the decades. When I first started publishing (really, it was blogging!) on the Web in 1996, I certainly had no idea how this medium would change and evolve over time‚Ä¶and myself along with it.</p><p class="">But if I could step into a real-life wayback machine and give my past self one simple piece of advice, it would be this:</p><p class=""><strong>Don&#x27;t shut it down. Migrate it!</strong></p><p class="">Instead of doing that, here&#x27;s the pattern I kept repeating all throughout the late 90s into the 2000s and even the 2010s: I&#x27;d launch a new website or online project of some kind, flounder along for a while, get bored, and then shut it down. Fast forward six months‚Ä¶a year‚Ä¶two years, and I&#x27;d decide to give something sort-of similar a try‚Äîbut rather than parlay whatever success I might have had to begin with into this new venture, I&#x27;d essentially be starting over from scratch.</p><p class=""><strong>Content creators of the world: hear me! This is NOT how to go about things!</strong> üòÖ</p><p class="">While I think it&#x27;s perfectly alright to launch new ventures rather than endlessly tweak just one, or be willing to step away from an idea that just isn&#x27;t coming together, you&#x27;ve got to be smart about it. Find a way to keep a through line, make it easy for your audience to travel along with you as you experiment‚Ä¶take the time to craft an ongoing narrative of your artistic journey so you have a meaningful sense of legacy.</p><p class="">The modern incarnation of <a href="https://theinternet.review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Review</a> I worked on really helped me to see this, as its almost 30-year-old archive was pulled from a number of online properties I&#x27;d started (and mostly stopped) over the years‚Ä¶yet once all that content was gathered together in one place, I could finally get a clear picture of how I&#x27;d grown as an author <em>and</em> how I&#x27;d remained true to the same values in many cases over many years. Reviewing these materials, one minute I would laugh at something said decades ago which proved to be wildly inaccurate or just plain bad‚Ä¶and the next minute I would be amazed at a sentence I&#x27;d written in a past era which sounds <em>exactly</em> like something I&#x27;d say today.</p><p class="">That&#x27;s the power of <strong>legacy</strong>, of having a sense of permanence and genuine personal history. I believe as a content creator working in such a transient medium as the Web, it&#x27;s vitally important to put some extra effort into finding ways to maintain such permanence.</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class="">All the way back in 2012, having been inspired by the movie <em>The Vow</em>, <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/the-importance-of-crafting-your-creative-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote about the importance of crafting your creative environment</a>. In that case, I was talking about decorating a physical space with artifacts of your creativity and things which inspire your art‚Äîa tangible way to remind you who you are. While that&#x27;s a slightly different concept than what I&#x27;m writing about here, it&#x27;s all part and parcel of the same basic premise: building something which truly matters over the long term‚Äîeven if you&#x27;re &quot;merely&quot; a content creator.</p><p class="">These days I&#x27;m measuring projects in years or decades, not months‚Äîeven if they do morph and grow considerably and perhaps even get renamed at times. I want to focus on <em>evolution</em>, not <em>reincarnation</em>. And trust me, that&#x27;s not always easy! There&#x27;s a certain impulse at times to &quot;burn it all down&quot; and rage quit. Maybe come back at it one day in the future with an entirely fresh perspective. But I&#x27;ve learned you can effectively short-circuit that misguided process by adopting a much better one:</p><p class="">Bake an &quot;ebb-and-flow mindset&quot; <em>into</em> your creative process. Recognize there will be times when you will need to let your field lie fallow for a beat, and that&#x27;s totally OK. Expected even! People (myself included!) are always apologizing on social media that they haven&#x27;t blogged in a while when they <em>finally</em> just posted something. Guess what?</p><p class=""><strong>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that!</strong></p><p class="">The idea that you aren&#x27;t successful as a content creator unless you&#x27;re posting a mile-a-minute every day, all the time, without fail, without ever taking a break, is a <strong>lie</strong>. That has more to do with the punishment of bad Internet algorithms than anything related to the noble pursuit of good art. In fact, I would argue that a constant stream-of-publishing approach actually works <em>against</em> real artistic merit. (But that&#x27;s probably a whole essay unto itself.)</p><p class=""><em>Dearest reader</em>, I may not be Lady Whistledown, but I know enough to have embraced the truth that for everything there is a season. So rather than scramble to produce content like a maniac, burn out, feel guilty, and rage quit your projects‚Äîand then rinse-and-repeat twenty more times later in life‚Äîtry the better approach: <em>evolution</em>, not <em>reincarnation</em>.</p>
