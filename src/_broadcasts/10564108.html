<p>Over the years, my relationship with “timeboxing” has waxed and waned. There have been times (pardon the pun) when I have desired to <strong>TIMEBOX ALL THE THINGS</strong> 🙌 and there have been times when, like, I just want to be spontaneous, man. Channel my inner <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/86/11/bb/8611bb64008aebd982b40fff542e9767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dude</a> and <strong>abide</strong>.</p><p>Last year was mostly about abiding for me. Coming down from the stress of (a) a global pandemic, (b) getting divorced, and (c) moving, I had to put in some serious effort to <em>not</em> feel like doing anything at all was a serious effort.</p><p>I think I did OK—maybe even better than OK—but as I contemplate what my goals are for 2023, I&#x27;ve realized that just sort of wandering around Portland hoping the Tao will lead me to the perfect cafe where I can plop down and eek out a new blog post isn&#x27;t the season I am in anymore. That worked, for a time. But now I needed to add some more structure back in to my time.</p><p>So here we are, <strong>timeboxing once again</strong>. And so far, so good! Now what do I mean when I use the term <em>timeboxing</em> and how can you implement something like that in your life?</p><p>It&#x27;s really rather simple to explain (but not gonna lie, difficult to implement):</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write down a concise description of your perfect work day. Things like: &quot;8am: Breakfast with coffee or tea&quot; or &quot;1pm: Focus on client projects&quot; or &quot;3:30pm: Take a break to get some household chores done&quot;.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Actually adhere to your schedule as best you can for a few days.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Figure out what works and what doesn&#x27;t, or what&#x27;s missing, and adjust accordingly.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Rinse and repeat.</p>

<br/>
<p>🚨 BIG WARNING 🚨 Don&#x27;t make the mistake I&#x27;ve made in the past of trying to add all these &quot;timeboxes&quot; to your calendar. This isn&#x27;t a calendering technique. This is a &quot;how do I imagine my day might flow to optimize my energy levels and ensure my primary goals don&#x27;t fall off the wagon&quot; technique. So you should just have a ready note of some kind (<a href="https://jaredwhite.com/20221229/bear-home-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mine is linked from a pinned &quot;homepage&quot; in my notetaking app Bear</a>) containing your proposed schedule, and then reference that from time to time as you go about your day. Expect that on any given day, your timeboxes will shift around a bit. Maybe for some reasons I end up having breakfast at 9am instead of 8am. Or maybe I get chores done at 2pm instead of 3:30pm. Doesn&#x27;t matter! The point is that <strong>I&#x27;m still doing the things I set out to do</strong>, for the most part.</p>

<br/>
<p>I&#x27;m also quickly learning that I need to incorporate some unexpected details into my timebox reference note as I try it out. For example, the cafe I wanted to go to this morning for coffee &amp; breakfast has new “winter hours” and is now closed Tuesday &amp; Wednesday! So I&#x27;ll need to take that into account. I also discovered this morning that I&#x27;d forgotten to charge up both my iPad and my e-scooter. Clearly I need to add &quot;Make sure all important devices are charging!&quot; to my nighttime ritual.</p><p>Past me would have relished these little unexpected hiccups, taking them as a sign the Tao is leading me off on another path. And to a certain extent, that&#x27;s still how I like to roll. The <em>Abidance of the Dude</em> hasn&#x27;t completely escaped my mind. But if I want to accomplish all that I wish to this year, and feel genuinely productive without loosing my marbles in the process, <strong>it&#x27;s time to timebox</strong>.</p>
