<p>i can’t write it.</p><p>i can’t blog it.</p><p>i can’t record it.</p><p>i can’t send it.</p><p>i can’t release it.</p><p>i can’t play it.</p><p>i can’t perform it.</p><p>i can’t say it.</p><p>i can’t do it. :(</p><hr/><p>In the <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class/2023-02-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous issue of Creator Class</a>, I talked about the importance of <strong>Just Do It</strong>(tm). Don’t procrastinate, don’t come up with excuses, don’t lean too heavily on what everybody else is doing. Just. Do! It!</p><p>But the ability to do anything creative and meaningful is predicated on the emotional stamina and willpower to be physically <em>able</em> to do it. And sometimes…we just don&#x27;t have it. We don&#x27;t have the energy, or the confidence, or the right idea. We get overwhelmed. We get beat down. We get all tangled up in our heads.</p><p>I recently watched a new series on Hulu called <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17525252/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Up Here</a>, a musical romantic comedy which is much better than that sounds. 😄 Besides featuring great music from the talented folks behind hits such as <em>Frozen</em> and <em>WandaVision</em>, as well as delightful performances by the entire cast, <em>Up Here</em> does a remarkable job of visualizing and personifying the &quot;voices in our heads&quot; — the running dialogue many of us constantly struggle against.</p><p>You might boil down this internal monologue into one of two themes:</p><p>(a) <strong>You can&#x27;t do it</strong> (loser)</p><p>(b) <strong>You should do X</strong> (where X is something dumb that really isn&#x27;t what you want and doesn&#x27;t fit into your value system at all, but you feel the pressure to go along with it)</p><p>Sometimes you get <em>both themes</em> running in parallel, which will <em>really</em> bake your noodle. 😵‍💫</p><p>I&#x27;m not going to lie: this has been happening to me lately. At first it was a tiny &quot;splinter in my mind&quot; (to quote <em>The Matrix</em>), affecting only one particular aspect of my overall set of creative and lifestyle goals, but then it started to grow into more and more areas. Why does this happen? <strong>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know.</strong> It could be a variety of factors. Not enough sleep. Too much rain. Working on tax paperwork. Seeing yet another facile &quot;AI will take over the world!&quot; headline in my newsfeed. 🤮</p><p>Regardless of <em>why</em> this happens, the point is that it happens to all of us at one time or another. And like many sorts of problems we face in life, the only way past it is to acknowledge it and be honest about what you&#x27;re struggling with. <em>And then tell those voices to go pound sand.</em></p><p>“You can&#x27;t do it, loser.” <strong>Well, maybe I can&#x27;t. But I can still make the attempt and know that I gave it my all.</strong></p><p>“You should do X.” <strong>Well, maybe I should. But I choose not to. I&#x27;m waiting for a better idea to come along which fully aligns with my values and my goals.</strong></p><p>Some days you may feel like you&#x27;re losing this fight. At the risk of sounding extremely corny, never give up! <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/35/fa/f235fab597dac2b6c500ee345b2a4c58.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Never surrender!</a> 😉</p><p>Your future self will thank you. Now go get some sleep. 😴</p>

<h3>Across the Fediverse</h3>

<p>It&#x27;s been a little while since the last issue of Creator Class, so <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there are a few podcast episodes of Fresh Fusion</a> you may want to catch up on. Some of the themes I touch on include the exciting growth of <strong>ActivityPub</strong>, the protocol powering open web social networks like Mastodon, Pixelfed, and, soon, Flipboard! As &quot;Big Social&quot; continues to implode, I continue to appreciate the fact we have truly viable alternatives which are helping to push the open web forward.</p><p>On an odd and very personal note, I wrote about <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/links/20230325/dont-kiss-me-im-irish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my surprising experiences in the past dealing with ethnic stereotypes</a>—surprising because I&#x27;m &quot;white&quot; and one might assume impervious to any sort of cultural faux pas. While of course any frustrating experiences I&#x27;ve ever had can in no way compare to the experiences of people who are Asian, or Black, or [insert literally any ethnic minority in America], I think the treatment of different/unfamiliar cultures—especially in popular media—is a topic we should all strive to understand and do better with.</p><p>Finally, I posted a couple of &quot;minimal talking&quot; street view-style videos around downtown Portland—<a href="https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20230306/portland-snowpocalypse-in-4k-hdr-walkabout-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a walkabout in the fresh snow</a>, and <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20230405/download-portland-scooter-ride-waterfront-views-in-4k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fun scooter ride along the Portland Waterfront</a>. Enjoy!</p>
