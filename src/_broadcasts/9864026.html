<p>üìà I&#x27;ve never been as popular on Twitter as I am right now. It&#x27;s literally making money for me in the form of organic advertising for my services and products. This is the stuff of creators&#x27; dreams, right?</p><p>Simultaneously, <strong>I&#x27;ve never been as nervous about social media self-destructing</strong> and taking us all down with it as I am right now. ü•∫</p><p>The absolute <em>bonkers looniness</em> swirling around Elon Musk&#x27;s yes-no-yes-no-yes? takeover attempt of Twitter shows no signs of slowing.</p><p><strong>Meta is a dumpster fire.</strong> I can literally pull up satellite images of Menlo Park and see the smoke rising. (OK, maybe a slight exaggeration‚Ä¶)</p><p>TikTok is at the height of its popularity right now with room to grow, but serious questions about its use of user data, OS-level privacy, long-term effects on mental health (like Instagram), and connection to bad actors on the global stage remain troublesome. (<strong>I personally find the product abhorant and will never use it.</strong>)</p><p>YouTube remains sort-of-OK-not-too-horrible mainly by sticking to its tried-and-true formula. Other than Shorts which I completely ignore, the YouTube viewing / uploading experience seems much the same as it was years ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4juSAp9jQjA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Even CaseyNeistat is back and vlogging in NYC</a>, and everyone is feeling that blessed wave of nostalgia. In today&#x27;s fractious media landscape, I find it somewhat refreshing.</p><p>ü§™ All this to say, <strong>I am done expecting social media to clean house any time soon.</strong> It&#x27;s a f****** mess.</p><p>üòÉ Thankfully, there are other technologies you can use to publish your own content which remain as useful and relevant today as they were 20 years ago. I&#x27;m talking about:</p><ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Blogs</strong>. If you don&#x27;t have one yet, what are you waiting for? The best time to start a blog was yesterday. <em>The next best time is now.</em></span></li><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Podcasts</strong>. Oddly enough, the open format of the podcast remains as viable now as its ever been, and attempts by certain companies with ill-intent (*cough* Spotify *cough*) don&#x27;t seem to have had much of an effect‚Äîat least not in any circles I swim in. <em>If you have something to say, say it on a podcast.</em></span></li><li class="list_item"><span><strong>Newsletters</strong>. I actually have a bit of a bone to pick with the state of newsletters right now‚Äîparticularly the community of Substack. It feels like every time I see a link to a Substack newsletter, I end up wading through a<strong> </strong><em><strong>massive</strong></em> screed that will take me an hour to finish. I simply don&#x27;t have that kind of time! üòÇ So here&#x27;s my hot take: newsletters should be SHORT, EASILY READABLE, and largely link to EXISTING BLOG CONTENT. I&#x27;m just not going to read your lengthy newsletter in my email app. But if it&#x27;s <strong>concise</strong>, <strong>to the point</strong>, and contains <strong>interesting links</strong> to elsewhere on the web? <em>Absolutely.</em></span></li></ul><p>I&#x27;ll also mention‚Äîif you&#x27;re into photography‚Äîthat I&#x27;m very bullish on Glass. (<a href="https://glass.photo/jaredcwhite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And I am indeed on Glass!</a>) Yes, it&#x27;s a proprietary platform. Yes, you have to pay for it. But that&#x27;s actually a good thing. It&#x27;s far-ar-ar better to be a legitimate customer of a proprietary platform (I include Discord in this category as well, plus YouTube if you&#x27;re a Premium subscriber) than use &quot;free&quot; ad-supported stuff, because then the incentives are actually aligned. Glass, Discord, etc. have one goal: make you happy so you keep paying for the product. Twitter, Facebook, etc. have one goal: make advertisers happy so they keep paying for the product (your eyeballs).</p><p><strong>My new workflow is to post photos on Glass (through their excellent iPhone app), then import them into my own blog.</strong> Yes, it&#x27;s a manual technical process at the moment (scraping their HTML essentially), but hopefully they release an official API soon.</p><p>üì£ In summary, while I continue to publish content on &quot;Big Social&quot; and grow my subscriber bases there, I am by no means under the illusion they care about my audience or my values as a creator. They use me to make them money, I use them to reach people. That&#x27;s really the end of it. Otherwise: <strong>I&#x27;ll use tools on the open web that directly benefit my publishing goals</strong> whether they be open source or propretiary but customer-focused. <em>Own Your Own Content (OYOC)</em>. That&#x27;s the web I love.</p><p>üîó Some stuff I&#x27;ve posted lately on the blog:</p><ul class="unordered_list" style="list-style-position:inside"><li class="list_item"><span>‚Äã<a href="https://jaredwhite.com/20220926/publishing-hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Blog as Publishing Hub</a>.
