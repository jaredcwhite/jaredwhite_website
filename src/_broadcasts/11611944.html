<p>Something I&#x27;ve been struggling with so far this year‚Äî<em>even while knowing</em> that I was going to focus more in this direction in <strong>2023</strong>‚Äîis remaining confident while working on content projects which may not see the light of day for a while.</p><p>The lifecycle of lightning-fast communications on the internet has tended to lead us to believe <em>we always have to be blasting</em> some new piece of content out there or we&#x27;re not ‚Äúreal‚Äù creators. Quantity always wins over quality. Always. Two posts are better than one. Three podcast episodes are better than too. Four vlog episodes are better than three. <strong>WE NEED MOAR CONTENT !!!</strong> üò¨</p><p>At the beginning of this year, I recorded a Fresh Fusion episode which described <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/86/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my yearly theme and &quot;3 words&quot; for 2023</a>. The theme is &quot;The Year of Fine Art&quot; and my 3 words are &quot;Finesse, Inklings, Stewardship&quot;. I won&#x27;t go into those last two today, but instead let&#x27;s focus on my yearly theme as well as the word &quot;finesse&quot; because that&#x27;s where the challenge begins.</p><p>Because you see, dear Reader, it&#x27;s really hard for me to feel like I&#x27;m a ‚Äúreal‚Äù creator doing anything worthwhile when I&#x27;m spending days, weeks, even months toiling away on projects nobody else has looked at yet. If I toss off a quick toot or two on Mastodon, I get <em>immediate feedback</em> that people are &quot;engaging&quot; with my content. Same if I post a vlog episode and get some views. Same if I post a podcast episode.</p><p>But if I&#x27;m slowly plugging away on more in-depth words or visuals or code or whatever it may be that I know nobody will read, or watch, or use for some time to come, that&#x27;s when I start feeling <strong>The Void</strong>.</p><p><strong>The Void</strong> is that black pit of despair which slowly starts to creep up into your consciousness from whatever hell it&#x27;s escaped from. <strong>The Void</strong> is where all your sunny cheerfulness and rosy optimism about how great your projects are and how awesome they&#x27;re going to be once they&#x27;re done goes to die. <strong>The Void</strong> is where you begin to lose your nerve.</p><p>&quot;This is taking a lot of time.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s even going to care about this.&quot; &quot;I might put a ton of work into this, and then it won&#x27;t grow my audience or help my career at all.&quot; &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m just not cut out for this.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t even know what I&#x27;m doing!&quot; &quot;LOL, imagine me thinking this was ever a good idea.&quot; &quot;I should quit now while I&#x27;m ahead.&quot;</p><p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come to learn about <strong>The Void</strong>. <em>You can&#x27;t make any good decisions while you&#x27;re in there.</em> There&#x27;s only one productive solution, and that is to <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class/2023-04-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Out Fast</a>. Once you&#x27;re out of <strong>The Void</strong>, you can take a calm, measured, objective approach to evaluating your goals and your schedule and your commitments, and <em>then</em> take appropriate steps to course correct (if at all).</p><p>For example, just the other day I was taking a walk and in pretty good spirits, and I started thinking about how overwhelmed I had felt recently and how &quot;behind&quot; I was on some tasks, and I asked myself: &quot;OK, so maybe you have too much on your plate. Time for a check in. What do you need to drop?&quot;</p><p>And without much hesitation whatsoever, I answered my own question with a resounding &quot;<strong>Nothing!</strong>&quot; üòÜ</p><p>Yes, I have a lot going on right now. Yes, I could get more done on Projects A, B, and C sooner if I were to drop Projects D, E, and F. Yes, my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multipotentialite</a> nature sometimes gets the better of me. But you know what? <strong>I am supremely excited about everything I am actively working on right now.</strong> And I don&#x27;t want to drop <em>any</em> of it. <em>So to hell with you, </em><strong><em>Void</em></strong><em>.</em> I will keep plugging away at the projects I deem worthy, and sure, some stuff may not see the light of day for a while yet. But that&#x27;s fine. Eventually, it&#x27;ll be ready. And I&#x27;ll put it out there. <strong>And then I will bask in the glow of my accomplishments</strong>‚Äîregardless if anyone else ever cares. Because‚Äî<em>clich√© alert</em>‚Äîwhat truly matters in the end is the journey I took to get there, not the destination itself.</p>

<h3>Around the Fediverse</h3>

<p>The rise of Bluesky, a rival social network (presumably) to both Mastodon and Twitter, has gotten a lot of tongues wagging, and <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/94/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I recorded an episode of Fresh Fusion</a> all about my thoughts on the matter as well as referencing my past reporting on the topic (the Bluesky initiative was originally announced in December 2019, believe it or not).</p><p>And in other news‚Ä¶I now run a <strong>Flipboard</strong> &quot;magazine&quot; (really just a simple yet visually attractive link blog) called <em>Happy Cities</em>. I recently <a href="https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite/110277989514543267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tooted about it</a> and have been having a lot of fun working on it. While I do own a car, I intentionally live on the outskirts of downtown Portland, Oregon so I can easily walk or take public transit or use a micromobility vehicle (such as my beloved e-scooter) to go places, run errands, and get exercise. I think all mid-sized-and-up cities in America could dramatically decrease the number of cars on their streets and build new pedestrian and bike-friendly paths and gathering places for better health, safer communities, and stronger local businesses. Portland is often heralded as a mecca for transit-oriented development in the U.S., yet it still lags <em>far</em> behind what is happening in many European cities and beyond. We can do better. <a href="https://flipboard.com/@jaredcwhite/happy-cities-6retv5m2y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And we will.</a> </p>
