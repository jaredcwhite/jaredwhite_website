<p class="">A couple months ago, <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/20230626/support-structures-for-the-extremely-online">I blogged about</a> how much I had come to value having a creative &quot;support structure&quot; around me IRL (In Real Life) as I spend so much of my actual time working and conversing on the internet.</p><p class="">Recently this has been upgraded from ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù to absolutely vital to the success of my subscription service in progress, <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/the-future-is-intuitive">Intuitive Future</a>.</p><p class="">My primary focus right now is finishing a course for web developers all about <strong>frontend CSS architecture</strong> for <a href="https://spicyweb.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spicy Web</a>. I&#x27;ve worked on this in fits and starts for well over a year now, and I had just sort of run into a time/motivation wall. I knew I needed to make a <em>big swing</em> of some sort in order to get this over the hump and back into production.</p><p class="">In the aforementioned blog post, I mentioned &quot;writing alongside fellow artists and creatives&quot; ‚Äî this is a fantastic group based here in Portland which I first visited for noodling on some hobby projects. However, after going a couple of times it dawned on me that this would be the <em>perfect</em> environment to keep chipping away at my CSS course.</p><p class="">And so I&#x27;ve been going and chipping and chipping and going. My immediate priority is to get a concrete sense of how much work I really have left to accomplish so that I can feel confident publicly announcing <strong>an official release date</strong>. And of course, by releasing this course I also have to &quot;release&quot; Intuitive Future as well because the two are joined at the hip, so that too is part of the whole mix.</p><p class="">All that to say, <em>exciting things are happening</em> but the likely side effect is a reduced schedule for <strong>Creator Class</strong> and the <strong>Fresh Fusion</strong> podcast over the next few weeks as I zero in on this top-priority project. It&#x27;s not ideal, because it&#x27;s been super-duper fantastic giving this newsletter &amp; the podcast solid attention this year, and I felt like I&#x27;d really hit my stride.</p><p class="">But sacrifices must be made, and this course <em>must</em> get done. Later today I&#x27;ll once again head off to the writers group, and if all goes well, I&#x27;ll have a plan to finish everything up and a release date I feel comfortable announcing.</p><p class=""><em>Wish me luck!</em> üòÑ‚úåÔ∏è</p>
