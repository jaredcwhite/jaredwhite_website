<p style="text-align:center" class="">Happy New Year, Dear Readers! üéâ</p>

<p class=""><strong>I stopped caring.</strong> I won&#x27;t let the voices in my head beat me down any longer.</p><p class="">‚ÄúIt&#x27;s cheating to do [insert seemingly nefarious act here] to feel creative and inspired.‚Äù</p><p class="">OK sure, it&#x27;s cheating! So what?</p><p class=""><strong>Whatever is going to get you creating is fair game.</strong> Don&#x27;t let your internal monologue convince you it&#x27;s wrong to buy a new desk, or a new lens, or switch to a new app for organizing information, or binge-watch that rad new TV show. Anything that may help you get out of a funk and back into the spirit of feeling more creative, <strong>do it</strong>.</p><p class="">I&#x27;m not saying you should be indulging in your favorite sugary candy bar <em>every time</em> you sit down to work on a video edit‚Äîbut hey, if that&#x27;s really going to get those creative juices flowing‚Ä¶well, just be sure to brush regularly! üòÖ</p><p class=""><em>Cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat.</em></p><p class="">‚Äã<br/>The enemy is not the emotional and physiological crutches you need to get your mind and body engaged in the perfect artistic flow. <strong>The enemy is apathy, doubt, and defeat. </strong>You must strive with every fiber of your being to kick negative self-talk to the curb (such as talking yourself out of pursuits, practices, and‚Äîyes, even indulgences‚Äîwhich might spark your imagination).</p><p class="">Listen, if I were more disciplined, <strong>I would intentionally write down a list</strong> of all sorts of things which help me feel inspired and pumped to work on creative projects‚Ä¶<em>and add to that list regularly</em>.</p><p class="">Going on a long walk and then enjoying a good cup of coffee certainly rises near the top. But it may be totally different for you‚Äî<em>and that&#x27;s OK!</em></p><p class="">Maybe you don&#x27;t suffer from this problem, but I&#x27;m always trying to talk myself out of taking radical steps to upgrade my creativity to the next level. Heck, <strong>I&#x27;ll feel guilty</strong> spending a bit of money to book a hot desk at WeWork‚Äîeven though I know without a doubt I&#x27;m much more productive on the days I go out to work at a coworking space.</p><p class="">This year I&#x27;ve set a goal for myself: Screw that! No more guilt. No more apologies. <strong>No more excuses.</strong></p><p class=""><em>Cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat cheat.</em></p><p class=""><em>Do whatever you need to do‚Ä¶short of breaking the law or your own moral code!‚Ä¶and GET CREATIVE. </em>üí™</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class="">What creative projects are you excited to start working on this new year? <a href="/about">What can I do to help you</a> get past creator&#x27;s block and start getting shit done? üßê</p>

<h3 class="">Across the Fediverse</h3>

<p class="">In my first podcast episode of the new year, <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/106/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Review‚Äôs Rebirth in 2024</a>, I talk about a new chapter dawning in my history as a blogger: I&#x27;m thrilled that literally for the first time ever, I&#x27;ll have a mostly-complete chronicle of all my tech blogging over the span of almost 30 years‚Ä¶plus a platform to continue that momentum. I&#x27;ve had my <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JaredWhite.com blog</a> for a long time of course, but it&#x27;s never been just for &quot;tech journalism&quot; per se. And I&#x27;ve had web development blogs like <a href="https://www.spicyweb.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spicy Web </a>and <a href="https://thathtml.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That HTML Blog</a> which I will keep on rocking.</p><p class="">However, with <em>The Internet Review</em> I can finally add my commentary to the Big Topics of the day, which these days often revolves around the ascension of the Fediverse and the cultural shift away from proprietary corporate silos. <em>Exciting stuff!</em> And very much in keeping with what I like to talk about here on <strong>Creator Class</strong> as well.</p><p class=""><strong>Another big goal for the year:</strong> migrate off of Glass (a small pay-to-join social network for photographers which I really appreciate‚Ä¶but just doesn&#x27;t do it for me any more due to the lack of ActivityPub federation) and <a href="https://pixelfed.social/@essentiallife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start posting regularly on Pixelfed</a>. If Mastodon is the &quot;Twitter&quot; of decentralized social networking, Pixelfed is the &quot;Instagram&quot; ‚Äî and I really see it coming into its own in 2024. What&#x27;s particularly great about using it is I can <strong>boost</strong> anything I post on Pixelfed via my Mastodon account, and It. Just. Works. Imagine a past world where you could retweet Instagram photos directly via your Twitter account. Crazy, right? Yet that&#x27;s EXACTLY what is now possible with Mastodon + Pixelfed. <em>A match made in nerd heaven.</em> üòá</p>
