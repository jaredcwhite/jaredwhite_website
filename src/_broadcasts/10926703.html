<p>In a <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/newsletters/43" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsletter issue a few years back</a>, I wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>A quote attributed to actor Christopher Walken goes like this: ‚ÄúIf you want to learn how to build a house, build a house. Don‚Äôt ask anybody, just build a house.‚Äù</p></blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd hire Christopher Walken to build me a house.</p>

<p>(But I‚Äôd certainly hire him to play foreman on TV. The man can act!)</p>

<p>Why do I bring this up? I appreciate the quote‚Äôs overall sentiment, which is that the best way to learn how to do something is simply by doing it. Don‚Äôt procrastinate, don‚Äôt come up with excuses, don‚Äôt lean too heavily on what everybody else is doing. Just. Do! It! as Shia LaBeouf would say. (Or was that Nike?)</p>

<p>Well I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;d hire Christopher Walken to build me a house, especially since it seems like he&#x27;s retired from working at <a href="https://lumon.industries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lumen Industries</a>. üòè</p><p>But I continue to appreciate the sentiment that building things, crafting things, producing things, publishing things‚Äîthat is how you learn as an artist. As I alluded to in the <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class/2023-02-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous issue of Creator Class</a>, I&#x27;ve been building things, crafting things, producing things, publishing things since I was a child. I&#x27;ve always just gone for what I want to work on with little hesitation‚Ä¶no need to sort out training or schooling or applying for an internship or whatever it is people normally do to prepare for a vocation. I like to say I &quot;fell into&quot; web development, and the fact that I happen to be fairly good at it and make fairly good money with it today is as much a quirk of fate as it ever was any intentional planning on my part. (Truth be told, there have been a number of times over past two decades when I&#x27;ve wanted to get <em>out</em> of this career altogether! No longer, I&#x27;m happy with where I am at present.)</p><p>So this may all sound very dreamy and free-spirited to some, but the flip side is I sometimes freeze up when I contemplate trying to do something new far beyond my current wheelhouse of skills. It&#x27;s all very well and good to say &quot;just build a house&quot; but if you don&#x27;t even know how to build a piece of furniture yet‚Ä¶maybe set your sights on something a little less ambitious first!</p><p>That&#x27;s essentially what my primary tug-of-war is this year. I <em>know</em> I want to push some boundaries and get out of my comfort zone as an artist and as a traveler, but I think perhaps that muscle of <strong>Just Do It!</strong> has gotten a little soft with the passing years. (Er, not the only muscle that&#x27;s gotten soft, amirite? üòÜ) I have my &quot;day job&quot; of working on client projects, and this newsletter, and the Fresh Fusion podcast, etc., and I&#x27;m feeling good about all of those things. <em>Everything is groovy now, so why rock the boat? Enjoy what you have! Take a breather! Reap the rewards! Stay on the straight and narrow!</em></p><p>Or‚Ä¶just build a house, and fail miserably at multiple stages along the way because that&#x27;s the best way to learn. At least, that&#x27;s the best way to learn <strong>for me</strong>. I&#x27;m at the point in my life now where I accept the sometimes odd ways in which I thrive and find fulfillment in life. I fully realize it&#x27;s not for everyone. I sometimes imagine myself living the life of someone I admire, and I quickly realize <em>I would absolutely hate</em> being them. And the opposite is true, I&#x27;m sure any number of people out there could imagine living my life and think it&#x27;s <em>absurd</em>. That&#x27;s a feature, not a bug!</p><p>But I digress. The point is, if you <em>are</em> anything like me, I want to encourage you to find the <strong>audacity</strong> to pick something new and just do it. You&#x27;ve probably done it before many times over. And yes, <strong>you can do it again</strong>.</p>


<h3>Across the Fediverse</h3>

<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon User Count bot</a> is reporting that we&#x27;re just about to pass 9.5 million known accounts, and it&#x27;s looking likely we&#x27;ll pass 10 million in just a few weeks. This doesn&#x27;t mean 10 million &quot;active&quot; accounts of course as active usage numbers are always much lower on any social network, but still, it&#x27;s a very exciting milestone. It seems the pace has picked up a bit too since the latest round of‚Ä¶well, You Know Who acting like a goon on You Know What. üòÖ</p>

<p>I recorded an <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode of Fresh Fusion</a> all about my quest to corrall YouTube into a more manageble source of media I engage with alongside all my other web-based subscriptions in Feedbin, rather than staying sucked into Google&#x27;s algorithmic corporate hellscape. And in the process, I discovered a really awesome new usage for my iPad Pro: <strong>iPad TV</strong>! <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out</a> ‚û°Ô∏è</p>

<p>And on the blog I published <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/20230213/theres-no-free-hot-tub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There‚Äôs No Free Hot Tub</a> about how technology is rarely additive and it&#x27;s wise to count the cost of adopting any new thing that comes along rather than blindly accepting its claim of world-changing transformation.</p>
