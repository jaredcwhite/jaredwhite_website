<p>
  Over the lifetime of the internet, we&#x27;ve seen many waves of technologies
  come and go for allowing disparate throngs of people to coalesce around a
  particular topic for ongoing discussion. Arguably, this was the first
  &quot;killer app&quot; for the internet. File sharing was all well and good,
  but when you could actually converse with people around the world about your
  favorite movies or an esoteric program or a language or a philosophy or a
  game? <strong>Dynamite.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  I&#x27;d like to look at some of these ebbs and flows of internet
  technologies, as we enter yet another era of the formation of interest groups
  called the &quot;<strong>threadiverse</strong>&quot; (threads + fediverse).
  More on that in a few moments.

</p>
<h3>Usenet / Mailing Lists</h3>
<p>
  Predating even the World-Wide Web (we&#x27;re talking 80s tech here!), both
  newsgroups (aka Usenet) and listservs (aka group mailing lists) allowed people
  to join in and participate in discussions on a near-infinite number of topics.
  Just find the newsgroup or listserv which tickled your fancy, and you were
  part of a potentially <strong>globe-spanning conversation</strong>. And
  don&#x27;t forget about the flame wars‚Ä¶epic!
</p>
<h3>Indie Web Forums</h3>
<p>
  Once the World-Wide Web really kicked into high gear, we witnessed the rise of
  independently-run forums on all sorts of interest-based websites.
  <strong>Remember phpBB?</strong> I myself ran forums on a number of occasions,
  all on topics ranging from technology to music to games. Forums sometimes
  accompanied blogs, and in certain cases even served as a blog commenting
  system. Some still do to this very day!
</p>
<h3>Centralized Destinations: Facebook / Digg / Reddit</h3>
<p>
  As with so many stories of the evolution of the web in recent decades,
  starting in the early-to-mid 2000s we began to see consolidation and
  centralization around a small number of <strong>well-funded</strong> and
  oft-hyped properties. Google Groups and eventually Facebook Groups became an
  easy way to set up discussions revolving around particular themes. Sites like
  Digg and later Reddit served as &quot;<strong>link aggregators</strong>&quot;
  which could offer forum-like discussion mechanics around topics of interest.
  SEO &quot;juice&quot; ensured that the most popular sites would return the
  fastest Google search results, so the bigger you were, the bigger you&#x27;d
  remain. <strong>We were all sucked in.</strong> Escape‚Ä¶not so easy!
</p>
<h3>Chat Servers: Slack / Discord</h3>
<p>
  Ephemeral chat rooms had long been a thing on the internet, with even
  protocols like IRC being in heavy rotation, but the emergence of Slack and
  later Discord proved you could <strong>blend concepts</strong> from email,
  chat, and discussion forums together to provide new ways of bringing folks
  together around particular subjects or tools or organizations. Even now, I
  personally am involved in a number of Discord servers and have made many nerd
  friends this way!
</p>
<h3>Going Back to the Future: Hello ‚ÄúThreadiverse‚Äù</h3>
<p>
  Which brings us to an <strong>astounding moment</strong> in internet history.
  With the meltdown of Twitter in the age of Elon bringing with it a resurgence
  of interest in decentralized social networking protocols and the rapid growth
  of the ActivityPub-based &quot;fediverse&quot; (listen to my recent
  <a
    href="https://justaspec.buzzsprout.com/1863126/13082534-activitypub-the-fediverse-and-you"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >Just a Spec podcast episode</a
  >
  all about it with my good friend Ayush), we have now begun to see a parallel
  explosion take place. The bigwigs at Reddit, seeing the dumpster fire that is
  today&#x27;s Twitter and wanting a piece of <em>that</em> action (for reasons
  which are utterly beyond me‚Äî<a
    href="https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class/2023-01-13/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >though I predicted this MONTHS ago</a
  >), have decided to screw the pooch and go to war with their moderator
  community and third-party app ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  Which has provided a <strong>welcome opportunity</strong> to do to Reddit what
  we&#x27;ve already been doing to Twitter: take a page from the web of old and
  set up a federated network that&#x27;s
  <em>of the people, by the people, and for the people</em>.
</p>
<p>
  The primary software projects (and ActivityPub-based instances thereof), Kbin
  and Lemmy,
  <a
    href="https://fedidb.org/current-events/threadiverse"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >are on a <em>rapid</em> growth trajectory</a
  >, adding tens of thousands of people (possibly hundreds of thousands of
  people) on a daily basis! And what&#x27;s so exciting about this new
  opportunity is not only can you create a new community on, say,
  <a href="https://kbin.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >kbin.social</a
  >, just like you might create a new subreddit‚Äîyou can simply set up and run
  your own &quot;threadiverse&quot; instance if you so wish! Like with Mastodon
  et al.,
  <strong
    >people from one instance can upvote, converse, and otherwise engage with
    content from another instance</strong
  >. I have an account on kbin.social, but I can follow communities on other
  instances running Kbin, or Lemmy, or potentially any other compatible
  software! And because it&#x27;s all ActivityPub under the hood, there&#x27;s
  even a degree of federation with Mastodon and other microblogging-style
  services. I can post or comment in a threadiverse community, and then boost it
  from my main fediverse account.
  <strong>Everything interoperates. Whoa!</strong> It&#x27;s almost like‚Ä¶wait
  for it‚Ä¶we can all finally participate in a global <strong>web</strong> of
  communication and collaboration. ü§ì
</p>
<h3>If Not Now, When? If Not Us, Who?</h3>
<p>
  I see nothing but HUGE opportunity and upside with the rise of the
  threadiverse. For content creators in particular, this could end up being
  <strong>an even bigger deal</strong> than the initial spike of the
  Twitter-like fediverse with Mastodon et al. Our biggest challenge is building
  a sense of <strong>community</strong> around the art and topics and causes we
  care about. Just posting on your own profile to your own followers can only
  get you so far. What if a community‚Äî<em>or multiple communities</em>‚Äîcould
  spring up around what you&#x27;re creating or promoting? And what if you could
  actively participate in other communities and establish
  <em>real trust</em> such that, when you occasionally share what you&#x27;re
  working on, it&#x27;s not perceived as spam but rather as valuable content
  well worth sharing?
</p>
<p>
  And unlike the Google Groups or Facebook Groups or subreddits or Slack servers
  or whatevers of the past era of the internet, this time<strong>
    we&#x27;re setting things up right</strong
  >. No centralized services run by VC-backed bozos. Instead: open protocols.
  Powering open source software. You can pick an instance you like, running the
  software you like.
  <strong>Or you can run your own damn instance.</strong> It&#x27;s entirely up
  to you! <em>You&#x27;re in control!</em> You, the creator! Not Mark
  Zuckerberg. Not Elon Musk. (Though, let&#x27;s admit, it&#x27;d be awesome to
  <a

    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >see them in a cage fight</a
  >.) Not Steve Huffman. Not some venture capital firm in Silicon Valley looking
  to cash out. Not some smarmy board of investors.
</p>
<h3>Creators of the World: Unite!</h3>
<p>
  The key missing ingredient to the so-called &quot;creator economy&quot; over
  the last decade or more has been
  <em>actual ownership of the platforms we use</em> to publish, share, sell, and
  discuss our work. The fediverse, and the threadiverse along with it,
  <strong>seeks to upend</strong> that unacceptable imbalance. We
  <em>finally</em> have the rare opportune moment to right past wrongs and build
  a better internet‚Ä¶one that puts creators, fan communities, and
  independently-run operators in charge. <em><strong>Carpe diem!</strong></em>
</p>
<p>We might never get another chance like this one.</p>
