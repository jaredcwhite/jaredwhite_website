<p>I&#x27;ve just arrived back from from a week of travel. (My destination was‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶very <a href="https://mysterium.net/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Myst-erious</a>!)</p><p>After conferring, conversing, and otherwise hob-nobbing with my fellow wizards‚Äîand <a href="https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite/110659109203612012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enjoying some fun in the sun</a>‚ÄîI had time to reflect during the trip home on how much energy I&#x27;m willing to spend (or not) on various topics I tend to opine about.</p><p>And the conclusion I came to was‚Ä¶gee, it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to stop caring about <em>a whole lotta stuff</em> when you&#x27;re on a boat on a lake with a beer. üç∫üòÜ</p><p>But seriously üòâ, it&#x27;s true that in the day-to-day haze of being A Person On The Internet, it&#x27;s only human nature to get caught up in, ah, spirited debate and any immediate discourse at hand. Sometimes that can be the spice of life, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it.</p><p>Nevertheless, I do find myself (and this has been ongoing for a while now) increasingly wanting to simultaneously put <em>more</em> effort into speaking on the topics I really do care about all while putting <em>less</em> effort into quibbling or bickering about the stuff I really should take a step back from.</p><p>Not every hill is worth dying on, not every fight needs to be fought <em>right here and now</em>. And even more to the point, sometimes the best way to win the war is to sue for peace.</p><p>There&#x27;s nothing shameful about conserving your energy, holding back, and storing up important reserves for <strong>one day</strong>.</p><p>I will always love social media, blogging, podcasting, and all the rest of it, but it can definitely mess with your head sometimes and make you assume Everything is Important and You Can&#x27;t Miss Out and Your Voice Must Be Heard‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.</p><p>Or‚Ä¶you can choose to put the phone down, walk away from the keyboard, and look up at the stars.</p>

<h3>Across the Fediverse</h3>

<p>Everybody&#x27;s talking about Threads, the new &quot;microblogging&quot; social network by Meta. I&#x27;ll spare you the details because I suspect you already know about them. It just launched, and lots of people I know are trying it out.</p><p>I&#x27;m very mixed about trying it out myself. On the one hand, I kind of feel like it&#x27;s my &quot;job&quot; to try it out and report my thoughts and what it could mean for Mastodon and open federated networks going forward.</p><p>On the other hand‚Ä¶Facebook. <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RPLM6bg0rEs/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. ü§¢</p><p>There&#x27;s a reason I left FB &amp; Instagram a long time ago, y&#x27;know?</p><p>So I dunno. Maybe I&#x27;ll run a Mastodon poll and ask people what I should do. Or I could ask you, dear reader! WHAT SHOULD I DO??!! Shoot me an email (<a href="mailto:jared@jaredwhite.com">jared@jaredwhite.com</a>) and tell me!</p><p>Of course there&#x27;s absolutely no chance I&#x27;ll start &quot;using&quot; Threads. I&#x27;m <em>very</em> happy on my instance of choice (<a href="https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWeb.social</a>), and I see no reason to budge. But there&#x27;s no question the launch of Threads will have a profound effect on the growth trajectory of the Fediverse. If that results in a net positive or negative over time‚Ä¶well that remains to be seen.</p>
