<div><h2 style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:24px">BIG Changes Coming to Creator Class!</span></h3><p>​<br/>That’s right, there are <em>ch-ch-changes</em> coming to this newsletter…in part <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/the-future-is-intuitive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summarized in a blog post I wrote here</a>.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I’m in the early stages of launching a subscription service which will provide educational content for creators and software developers. Essentially more—a <em>lot</em> more—of everything I have been doing, as a launching pad for further ambitious projects. <em>w00t!</em></p><p>To build upon what I said in my blog post, there’s more to my goal of <em>finally</em> taking content production seriously and turning it into a viable career than simply time + money. I have come to realize the <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/jab-jab-jab-right-hook-gary-vaynerchuk/1115122809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</a> school of social media marketing is fundamentally broken.</p><p>(Not that I would know. I never read the book! 😅)</p><p>The problem is: when you play the social media game, you’re entirely at the <strong>mercy of the platforms</strong> upon which you’re trying to build your sales funnel. You gotta amass <strong>100,000</strong> followers so you can get <strong>10,000</strong> people to pay any attention at all so you can get <strong>1,000</strong> true fans to engage with your business. (And increasingly, you have to pay to even reach <em>them!</em>)</p><p>But what happens when those 1,000 true fans happen to live on a platform with goes belly-up tomorrow? (In spirit, if not downright technically…)</p><p>Facebook. Instagram. TikTok. Twitter. Reddit. Guess the commonality between all of them? <strong>I ain’t on them!</strong> 🤓</p><p>I refuse to play their games. Time for a change. <strong>A big, big change.</strong></p><p>And so I’m building my own service. 🤯 I’ll rely on the fans I already have. That’s you! 💛 I’ll rely on word of mouth. I’ll rely on the open web to increase my reach. <strong>Podcasts. The Fediverse. RSS. Email.</strong> I’ll work hard—damn hard—for each and every relationship I build, and the foundation of everything we do will be trust, integrity, finesse, expertise, and long-term stewardship of a healthy community.</p><p><strong>I’m so freaking excited.</strong></p><p>Now, about this newsletter. Don’t worry, <strong>Creator Class</strong> isn’t going anywhere. But in case you haven’t noticed, I don’t send out new issues as frequently as I would like. So that will be changing. I’ll still send out a free issue, probably once a month or so. In other words, like I&#x27;ve been doing. 😏 But beyond that, there will be an increased frequency as part of the new subscription. Our members will not only receive additional content, but hugely <strong>valuable</strong> content. I’ll dive deep—really deep—on how to level up as a content creator, how to find originality and out-of-the-box inspiration, and how to generally kick ass in this new era of open-protocols-based social media.</p><p>Not because I’m some fancy-pants guru who&#x27;s got it all figured out, but because you’ll get to come along on the journey with me! See what works, and what doesn’t. You&#x27;ll get my raw, unfiltered look at how to play this game differently. Every. Single. Time. And I&#x27;ll share what I&#x27;ve learned from other creators of note who are garnering success on their terms.</p><p>Do you desire to create <strong>Art &amp; Entertainment That Matters</strong> without selling your soul to Musk and Zuckerberg and Huffman and Altman? Me too! <strong>We’ll do this. Together.</strong></p><p>More details soon. Your feedback is gold. Let me know what you think (just reply to this email), and especially what you’d like to see more of here at Creator Class! ✌️<br/>​</p><p><em>Cheers,<br/>Jared </em>😊</p><p>​<br/>​</p></div>
