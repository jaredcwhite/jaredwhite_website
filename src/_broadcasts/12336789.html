<p class="">Yeah, I‚Äôm real fun at parties. üòè</p><p class="">There are days when I feel something like Greta Thunberg who somehow got invited to a Polluters of the World Summit held at the Kiss My Ass Opulence Resort. I mean, what do people expect me to do? Bite my lip and look cute?</p><p class="">But seriously, I wasn‚Äôt always quite this obnoxious about choices in consumer &amp; developer tech. Back in the early 90s, I had <em>no idea</em> any of this stuff could turn into an ethical minefield‚Ä¶at least not in the way we might think of industries such as tobacco or mining or weapons manufacturing or pharmaceuticals.</p><p class="">But once Microsoft &amp; the U.S. DOJ started duking it out, and I started trying out alternative PC operating system and realizing just how scummy of a company M$ was, it dawned on me that technology isn‚Äôt always neutral. Sometimes you have to <em>think</em> about what you‚Äôre actually using, and why.</p><p class="">The mid-2010s is when this process really seemed to kick into high gear. Over the course of the past eight years, I have stopped using:</p>

<ul class="unordered_list"><li class="list_item"><span>Facebook</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Google</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Instagram</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Twitter</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Reddit</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>Amazon</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>OpenAI/generative AI (never started using it to begin with!)</span></li><li class="list_item"><span>and a number of other tech products &amp; services‚Ä¶</span></li></ul>

<p class="">Like I said, <em>party guy</em>. That‚Äôs me. üòù</p><p class="">Listen, I‚Äôm not simply bloviating to paint myself as some sort of folk hero. I want to give YOU permission to take <strong>radical steps</strong> to avoid supporting companies and technologies which you find ethically compromised. I believe everyone must decide for themselves who and what they are or are not willing to support. I try not to judge individual cases‚Äîthough it&#x27;s increasingly hard for me to understand how <em>anyone</em> can stick with Twitter‚Ä¶I mean X at this point!</p><p class="">My plea is that you <em>actually decide</em> these things, and keep making these decisions over time. Don&#x27;t just blindly accept any product or service on the market simply because it might be useful or popular. When somebody says &quot;yeah‚Ä¶I know Amazon treats its workers poorly and hurts numerous small businesses and manufacturers, BUT‚Ä¶‚Äù I‚Äôd like to ask them: &quot;so what precisely would Amazon <em>need to do</em> to get you to stop buying from them?&quot; Because if they don&#x27;t have an answer to that, Amazon could get away with <strong>literally anything</strong>. Same for Google, or Microsoft, or Facebook, or anybody. Look at all the folks <em>still</em> using Twitter, I mean X! ü§™</p><p class="">Sometimes these questions are deeply uncomfortable. I realize that. Every day I still use YouTube, and I very heavily take advantage of Apple&#x27;s vast computing ecosystem. Both of those choices are top of mind. What might cause me to stop using YouTube outright? What might cause me to drop Apple products and find Linux-based alternatives? Ouch, that one&#x27;s real hard. But it&#x27;s a valid point to consider.</p><p class="">The takeaway is: <strong>You get to decide who you&#x27;re willing to support and promote</strong> as a technology consumer or developer. This is your power. This is your right. Don‚Äôt forget it. <em>Don&#x27;t take it for granted.</em></p><p class="">(And, well, try not to be <em>too</em> insufferable at parties‚Ä¶)</p>

<p class="">It&#x27;s been busy times lately! <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I just recorded Fresh Fusion&#x27;s 100th episode</a>, with guest Mariya Delano. She&#x27;s been crushing it over on Mastodon lately and writes a fabulous newsletter called <em>Attention Deficit Marketing Disorder</em>. We talked about the growth, distortion, and rebirth of an internet that&#x27;s of the people, by the people, for the people.</p><p class="">Don&#x27;t miss <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/99/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 99th episode</a> either about a new blog I recently launched for web developers called <strong>That HTML Blog</strong>. It was the shortest idea-to-launch timeframe I&#x27;ve dealt with in a long time, and I enjoyed the opportunity to take a step back afterwards and debrief.</p><p class="">And finally, I wrote an essay called <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/articles/cloud-of-a-thousand-talking-cats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud of a Thousand Talking Cats</a> as a sort of thought experiment to consider what it would mean for a company like OpenAI to actually stumble upon AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and the unbelievable storm it would unleash (for OpenAI). Do they <em>really</em> want to go there? üßê</p><p class="">‚Äã</p><p class=""><em>And that&#x27;s it for today&#x27;s installment of </em><strong><em>Creator Class</em></strong><em>. See you next week! ‚ÄìJ</em></p>
