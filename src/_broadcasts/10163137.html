<p>It may sound like I&#x27;m simply repeating the points I made in <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class/2022-10-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Issue #16</a>, but this is simply too important to ignore.</p><p>If there&#x27;s <em>any</em> clear takeaway for <strong>content creators </strong>from the tumultuous events of recent days, it is this:</p><p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:24px">If you don&#x27;t own your own content, </span><span style="font-size:24px"><strong>somebody else owns you</strong></span><span style="font-size:24px">.</span></p><p>Does that mean you should <em>only</em> publish content on your own website and no where else? No, of course not. That would be silly. üòÖ</p><p>But it DOES mean you should ensure content will ‚Äúflow‚Äù through your own domain under your own control. Whether or not you&#x27;re syndicating content coming from elsewhere, or originating content on your own website which then syndicates elsewhere.</p><p>As an example of this, I have a script I can run that will &quot;import&quot; a video I&#x27;ve published on YouTube to my own website. (<a href="https://jaredwhite.com/videos/20221018/seattle-vlog-japanese-garden-for-free-lake-sammamish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here&#x27;s a recent post showing this.</a>) However, it&#x27;s not a full import as the video itself is simply accessed via YouTube&#x27;s embedded player.</p><p>My next project is to add an integration with <a href="https://bunny.net/stream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bunny CDN</a> so that when I publish to YouTube, I can also upload the exact same video file to Bunny.  Then on my own website, I&#x27;ll actually have two tabs on every video page so you can choose whether to watch the video via YouTube or Bunny. Yes, that&#x27;s right. <strong>I&#x27;m effectively creating my own streaming service.</strong></p><p>Will that cost me though in terms of lower view counts on YouTube? Probably. <strong>But I&#x27;m done chasing views.</strong> It&#x27;s a fool&#x27;s errand. It&#x27;s much more important to me to (a) be completely in charge of my own destiny as a creator, and (b) actually use the web as it was intended before the hostile takeover of corporate media. I&#x27;ll also be able to experiment with ideas such as <strong>providing video files through RSS for playback in &quot;video podcast&quot; clients</strong>.</p><p>Truth be told, I didn&#x27;t even know until very recently that&#x27;s actually still a thing and that players from Apple Podcasts to Pocket Casts (now operated by Automattic, the stewards of WordPress) support video! If &quot;nerds&quot; like me <em>who are literally web developers</em> aren&#x27;t even aware of what&#x27;s possible using open web technology, how can we expect the &quot;normals&quot; out there to understand any of this?</p><p>Clearly a huge process of re-education needs to take place on <strong>what the open web is</strong>, how it works, and how to use it. Enough with the utter nonsense of &quot;follow me on Instagram&quot; or &quot;like this tweet&quot; or &quot;hit that bell notification&quot;. <strong>That&#x27;s doing nothing but feeding the monster of corporate media.</strong></p><p>The #1 refrain of a content creator should <em>always</em> be: <strong>go to my website and follow me there</strong>. &quot;Following a website&quot; through RSS or ActivityPub‚Äîor just old-school subscribing to an email newsletter‚Äîis the <em>only</em> technology you will always have direct control over, because those are all based on open standards and not under the thumb of any single corporation.</p><p>So go forth my friends and relish this moment! <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/now/2022-11-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As I say on my latest Now page</a>, ‚Äúwe thought corporations could learn how to be good citizens on the web, and that the benefits of centralized content outweighed the risks. We were wrong. And now a MASSIVE course correction is finally underway.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Finally.</strong></p><p><em>‚ÄôTill next time,</em></p><p><em>Jared</em></p><hr/><table width="100%" border="0" cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="0" style="table-layout:fixed" class="email-image"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><figure style="display:block;margin:12px 0;max-width:100%;width:800px"><a style="display:block;max-width:800px" href="https://jaredwhite.com/pictures/20221110/gazing-eastward-from-world-trade-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/nCsz6qJww724sm5RbVykHT/4TmBdCpVTjGhjwK92MjpoT/email?auto=" width="800" style="width:800px;max-width:100%;border-radius:9px"/></a><figcaption style="text-align:center;display:block"><em>Gazing Eastward from World Trade Center, Portland, Oregon</em></figcaption></figure></td></tr></tbody></table>
