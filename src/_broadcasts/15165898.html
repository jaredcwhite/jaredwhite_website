<p class="">You know the easiest, fastest, most immediately palpable method of getting your audience to engage? (And thus provide attention and/or money?)</p><p class=""><strong>Anger. ðŸ˜¡</strong></p><p class="">And lest you think I&#x27;m writing a treatise against that, <em>there&#x27;s definitely a time and a place for anger.</em></p><p class="">If you&#x27;re participating in the news cycle, there&#x27;s a never-ending list of things to get legitimately angry about. I won&#x27;t start listing them becauseâ€¦well, how many years ya got? ðŸ˜‚</p><p class="">The thing about anger is it <em>can</em> be used for noble purposes, noble causes. Sometimes the only way anything will ever change for the better is for folks to feel some righteous indignation. <em>There outta be a law! </em>people will shout when they find out local industry is pumping massive amounts of waste into their beloved river. And, well, they&#x27;re totally right!</p><p class=""><strong>But anger can also be used as a weapon. ðŸ˜¤</strong></p><p class="">We see so much of that too, especially when done so casually, so cynically in our online discourse. It&#x27;s oh-so-easy to mash on a keyboard for mere seconds, tap Post, and share our outrage with the world. And the more outraged they get, the more authority we have to fuel that outrage even further.</p><p class="">As a publisher, this weapon can be incredibly effective yet terribly risky. It&#x27;s a paper fire. It burns bright for a brief minute, and then it&#x27;s gone. <em>Poof, just like that.</em></p><p class="">And so begins this continuous cycle of getting more paper to throw on the fire to keep it going. The problem is, <em>it&#x27;s unsustainable</em>. To stretch this analogy to its breaking point, the &quot;outrage paper&quot; is coming from an ecology that will soon reach its limits. There&#x27;s just not an endless supply. At some point, you&#x27;ll reach the end.</p><p class=""><strong>And the fire dies. ðŸ’¨</strong></p><p class=""><strong>â€‹</strong></p><p class="">I see so much anger online right now, so much hostility, so many people assuming the absolute worst about anyone who might comment in a way they don&#x27;t immediately approve of. And before you point at me and yell <em>pot, meet kettle</em>, you&#x27;re absolutely spot on. I&#x27;ve been a part of this outrage machine myself at one time or another. Pick a topic, I&#x27;ve probably outrage-tooted about it or ranted on a podcast about it. Was I right about what I said? Perhaps even so!</p><p class=""><strong>Yet the outrage fire is a paper fire. At some point, you need to find sustainable, long-lasting fuel or you&#x27;ll flame out.</strong></p><p class="">I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot over the past few days as a creator. Ultimately, it&#x27;s vitally important to speak from a place of <strong>optimism</strong>, of hope. It&#x27;s crucial to put out wisdomâ€”even if it&#x27;s sometimes in the form of constructive criticismâ€”and leave your audience with ðŸ’¡ <em>a spark of insight</em> they might not have had before.</p><p class="">This is the harder work, <em>much harder</em>. It takes more time, it grows an audience more slowly. But over the days and weeks and months and years and decades, you just might find yourself comfortably warm by the fire of <em>understanding</em>. And in the end, <strong>understanding is the most valuable currency in communication</strong>.</p><p class="">My #1 goal for the coming week: less time spent stoking the fires of outrage, and more time spent stoking the fires of understanding. <em>You with me?</em></p>
