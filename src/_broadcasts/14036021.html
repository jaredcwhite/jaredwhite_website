<p><em>Note: this issue went out last month to <a href="https://plus.intuitivefuture.com">members of Intuitive+</a> and I thought it was worthy of re-publishing here on the blog. Enjoy!</em><br/>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="">If we&#x27;ve seen anything over the past 12-18 months, it&#x27;s that we&#x27;ve seen the shocking meltdowns of numerous commercial platforms content creators rely on every day. <strong>Twitter/X</strong>. <strong>Reddit</strong>. And now, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/why-platformer-is-leaving-substack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Substack</strong></a>. The list goes on and on. At this point, every VC-funded platform for content creators is suspect. <em>Ticking time bombs</em>. üí£ (I&#x27;m presently side-eying <strong>Discord</strong> &amp; <strong>Patreon</strong>, both primed to explode into full-blown ‚Äúenshittification‚Äù at any moment‚Ä¶)</p><p class="">üò¢ It&#x27;s enough to put a damper on the brightest of spirits for any content creator.</p><p class=""><em>üí™ But we carry on!</em> And what I want to encourage you to do today is put some thought into where you might travel next in this grand migration towards more open services.</p><p class="">Some migrations are easier than others. I found my personal migration from Twitter/X to Mastodon somewhat obvious, given that I&#x27;d already had a lot of experience in 2018/2019 with Mastodon and the fediverse. But migrating certain <em>business/creative projects</em> to Mastodon felt more daunting, and some stuff just fell by the wayside for a while.</p><p class="">Migrating from Reddit to <a href="https://lemmy.world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lemmy</a> &amp; Kbin wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me because I was mostly a lurker on Reddit, and furthermore that platform was never a key driver of traffic for me. But I understand for some other communities, it&#x27;s been very painful.</p><p class="">Substack likewise doesn&#x27;t impact me personally, but I know it <em>really, really sucks</em> for a lot of creators out there. I already went through newsletter-related pain when I had to migrate off of Revue (a subsidiary of Twitter which was shut down post-Elon acquisition). Thankfully, <a href="https://convertkit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConvertKit</a> has proven to be a worthy replacement.</p><p class="">What I&#x27;m rather dreading right now is what to do about <strong>Discord</strong>. Granted, the service <em>right now</em> is working quite well for the servers I host (like <a href="https://discord.gg/CUuYVH7Qa9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spicy Web</a>), but as the title above alludes to, I&#x27;m already working on my backup plan. I&#x27;m expecting at some point down the road to have reason to abandon Discord. So what could replace that? Numerous options abound, none as particularly obvious or relatively clear-cut as the Twitter -&gt; Mastodon migration. Furthermore, a lot of people who join Discord servers do so because they&#x27;re already on Discord generally. If you move off of that to literally anything else, you run the risk of alienating a lot of folks in your community.</p><p class="">But as prickly as these topics get, we as content creators can no longer afford the luxury of turning a blind eye. Getting off of [Insert Commercial Platform Here] is something you MUST consider at regular intervals. Maybe you can&#x27;t do it today. Maybe you can&#x27;t do it tomorrow. But in 6 months? A year? Two years?</p><p class=""><strong>Very, very likely.</strong></p><hr /><p class="">In the meantime, the name of the game is <em>diversification</em>. Experiment NOW with new tools &amp; technologies, protocols &amp; platforms, which can help your overall usage patterns trend towards <em>open</em>. Don&#x27;t just post on Instagram, post on <a href="https://pixelfed.social/@essentiallife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixelfed</a> too. Don&#x27;t just post on YouTube, <a href="https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/107/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on PeerTube or your own website too</a>. Don&#x27;t just use Discord, use Matrix. (I&#x27;m just starting to experiment with that in earnest and will report back soon!) And for the love of all that is holy, get off of Twitter/X right the frack now. ü§™ Trying out both Mastodon AND Threads is a pretty winning strategy in my opinion.</p><p class=""><em>Let me know how it&#x27;s going!</em> And how I can do more with <a href="https://plus.intuitivefuture.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intuitive+</a> this year to help you with these important efforts.</p><p class="">Cheers. ‚ÄìJared</p></div>
