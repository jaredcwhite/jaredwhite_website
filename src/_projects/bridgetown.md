A next-generation, progressive site generator & fullstack framework, powered by Ruby. In fact, you're looking at a site built with this awesome framework right now! üòä

Built upon proven open source technology, Bridgetown is a fast, scalable, modular, and thoroughly forward-looking framework for building websites and frontend applications. My web studio [Whitefusion](https://www.whitefusion.studio) is ‚Äúall in‚Äù for Bridgetown and has big plans to make it not just a great Ruby-powered site generator by itself, but a central part of the "Dreamstack" to rival major competitors. This our chance as Rubyists to define the next ten years of building digital experiences and publications.

I'm on the Bridgetown core team, so if you decide to try it out please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
