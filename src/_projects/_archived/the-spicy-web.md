A blog, a Discord chat server, and a growing library of courses and videos all designed to help you learn how to build websites and applications from core ingredients. Get the "vanilla" fundamentals right, then add spices (complicated JavaScript, abstracted frameworks, ambitious build tools, etc.) only when and where they’re needed.

Spices are wonderful when used in moderation, and not too many of them all at once. Just be careful you don’t let them overwhelm the main dish.
