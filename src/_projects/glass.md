For a long time, I'd been down in the dumps about the state of publishing and sharing photographic content online. Because of the horrorscape that is ~~Facebook~~ Meta and its increasingly wretched Instagram product, I'd tried various other services including Flickr and Tumblr, but nothing really clicked for me.

Then along came **Glass**, a brand-new "indie" photo network for iOS and now the web. While it's early days yet for the platform, I feel like it's really coming into its own now, and I'm excited to start posting there more frequently. And most importantly, I finally feel inspired to take more photos. That alone is a good thing!
