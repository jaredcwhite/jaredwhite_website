_W00t!_ I launched a new podcast this summer. (Not because it's "summer"…like it's just some summer thing. It so happens to be summer at the moment. In the Northern Hemisphere, that is. Anyhoo…)

**Vibe Coded** is "a show about the perils & pitfalls of creative intellectual automation; and why the future of good Internet vibes is for the humans, by the humans."

Add it to your podcast player of choice, please and thank you!
