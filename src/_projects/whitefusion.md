Since I first got my start building websites in the 90s, I’ve seen entire subindustries of the web come and go. There’s always somebody promoting flashy yet overengineered technology. Thankfully, I’m not the only one decrying the complexity of the modern web. Cooler heads are prevailing, praise be to Berners-Lee.

As the founder of Whitefusion, a boutique web studio, I'm a champion of the underdog: the solo dev, the small tight-knit team. I believe you can build great things with simple, easy-to-understand tools and a commitment to the greatest invention in the history of mankind: the open web.
