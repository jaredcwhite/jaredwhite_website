Since I first got my start building websites in the 90s, I've always been a champion of the underdog: the solo dev, the small tight-knit team.

As the founder of **Whitefusion**, a boutique web studio based in Portland, Oregon, I believe you can build great things with simple, easy-to-understand tools and a commitment to open protocols and the grassroots indie web movement.
