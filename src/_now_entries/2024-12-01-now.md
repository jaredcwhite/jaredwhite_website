The end of the 2024 is rapidly approaching, and I feel oddly unprepared in a way that's unusual for me. Typically every close of the year I Make Plans‚Ñ¢ and set intentions and have a general sense of what I'd like to focus on in the New Year.

**2025? I haven't got a fucking clue.** üòÇ

In a way, I sort of _don't_ want to make all of those plans, y'know? Just _live in the moment, man_. Go with the flow. Feel the vibes. Take things one step at a time. And 0Ô∏è‚É£üñï given.

At least, that's on a personal level. On the professional side of things, I'm _fairly excited_ about pushing forward with everything I've already been doing‚Äîand then some.

* On the **Fresh Fusion** podcast, [I enumerated a list of things I'm thankful for](https://jaredwhite.com/podcast/120/).
* As my musical alter ego **Yarred**, [I released Subterranean](https://www.yarred.com/music), an electronic music album I'm so happy with, I'm already thinking of producing an immediate sequel (and possibly some remixes!).
* [Intuitive Future publishing](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com) continues apace, with four (!!) newsletters all in circulation .(including [Creator Class](https://jaredwhite.com/creator-class)).
* I've been setting up a new **mobile video production** rig based on [DaVinci Resolve for iPad](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve). Apple's iPad version of Final Cut Pro just doesn't cut the mustard for me‚Ä¶sadly a trend I've grown accustomed to with much of Apple's iPadOS efforts in recent years. Thankfully DaVinci seems like a pretty epic pro app even on iPad (once you hack a few features back in that are hidden by default).
* For the web developers out there, the [Bridgetown framework](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) is steadily barreling towards a 2.0 release, and I'm pretty stoked at the polish and robustness of the features and the refactoring of tech debt that's gone into this release. Really a highlight of my professional career.
* And I _might_ have some fediverse-related software in the works to kick off the new year‚Ä¶stay tuned. üòä

Alas, on a down note, my consulting business [Whitefusion](https://www.whitefusion.studio) floundered this summer, and my cash flow has been down by double digit percentage points as compared to past heights. I know lots of people got slammed this year by instability in the tech industry‚Äîmass layoffs, weird pivots of "AI", and other shenanigans‚Äîso I'm not alone. I'm also lucky compared to how bad it _could_ have gotten. But it's clear if I don't come up with a better strategy in 2025, I may be on the hunt for a new gig altogether.

A couple of highlights I'll end with in an attempt to stay positive:

I've been enjoying more face-to-face time with various friends and groups of people in the **Portland area**, and this has led to me leading a meetup group‚Äîa friend passed the leadership torch to be as she's pretty busy with a sibling meetup and other activities. So I'm very excited to be running the [Portland Vortex Creative Club](https://www.meetup.com/portland-vortex-creative-club/) and expect great to come in 2025.

I'm also _extremely thankful_ for my kids doing well in school‚Äîthriving even (and as you'll hear on the aforementioned Fresh Fusion episode, getting this far took a _herculean_ effort!). Did you know I'm the proud father of a _teenager_ now? **A TEENAGER!?!?** My, how time does fly‚Ä¶

So that's a bit of an end-for-year snapshot of what's going on in my life. [Follow me on Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@jaredwhite) for my daily stream of consciousness‚Ä¶and perhaps a few corny dad jokes!
