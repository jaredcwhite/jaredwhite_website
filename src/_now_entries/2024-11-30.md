The end of the 2024 is rapidly approaching, and I feel wildly unprepared in a way I haven't felt before. Typically every close of the year I Make Plans‚Ñ¢ and set intentions and have a general sense of what I'd like to focus on in the New Year.

**2025? I haven't got a fucking clue.** üòÇ

In a way, I sort of _don't_ want to make all of those plans, y'know? Just _live in the moment, man_. Go with the flow. Feel the vibes. Take things one step at a time. And 0Ô∏è‚É£üñï given.

That's on a personal level at least. On a professional level, I've been pretty busy lately, and thankfully I'm _excited_ about rolling right on into 2025 along similar lines.
