Yeah…so the [previous Now page](/now/2022-11-16) was up for an **ungodly** amount of time—as in the _entirety_ of 2023. 😅 Probably because it applied so well! It was essentially my call to arms to abandon ship on **Big Social** and head back to the warm embrace of the open web.

But the time it does fly, and here we are in the springtime of 2024. A lot-a-lot-a-lot has happened! I talked about some of the news [on a recent episode of Fresh Fusion](/podcast/113/), so check that out for deets and links.

This go round I'm going to share some general thoughts on progress now that we're a fair ways into the "rebirth" of the social internet (aka the post-Twitter media ecosystem), as well as some personal updates:

* Setting aside _all_ of the very real shit Meta has thrown up in our faces over the years, I have to give credit where credit is due. **Threads** is the best thing they've ever done. I mean, is it even a contest? (At least since the _very early days_ of Facebook when it was still just a fun little sandbox…or maybe right after the Instagram acquisition.) I'm **genuinely shocked** what a good product it is. I know I need to prepare myself for the eventual _enshittification_ process to begin, and Of Course I'm Not Saying we should all simply drop what we're doing on Mastodon and other platforms and just use Threads. _Perish the thought!_ But rather, Threads is providing a helluvalotta people some very real utility right now, including ours truly. [I've been posting iPhone shorts](https://threads.net/@essentiallifejared) of my travels around Portland and then immediately **boosting** them from my Mastodon account, and it's been _going quite well!_ I'm also following both [@potus](https://threads.net/@potus) and [@barackobama](https://threads.net/barackobama) right there in the Fediverse. **How cool is that?!**
* Now for the downer: the start of this year was a really hard time for my immediate family and me as a divorced father of two, and while I don't feel comfortable sharing much publicly, my close friends know what I'm talking about. 😕 It got so bad I finally overrode my cheapness/pride (mostly 80%/20% split there 😅) and sought out a therapist. _Dayum!_ I can easily say without a moment's hesitation that **regularly seeing a good therapist has been absolutely stellar** and something I really should have started doing years ago. Can you believe I hadn't been to one since _before_ 2020? Yeah, it's nuts. 🤪
* However, the unexpected flip side of the aforementioned difficulties is I've grown a lot closer to my parents—and my stepsister in particular. I'd actually known her from before her mom and my dad had gotten married, but we were merely casual acquaintances and happened to run in the same social circles—and in more recent times we'd barely stayed in touch. Now all of a sudden we're finding that we have a lot in common on various wavelengths, and she's delighted to be "auntie" to my kids (remotely at least…unfortunately we don't live in the same area). **Take your blessings wherever you can find them!** 🥰
* I'll close with this, to get back to full-on nerd punditry: **I've never published so many different blogs in my life.** Truly, it's _bananas_. 🍌🍌 While I've _always_ had the problem where if I ran into somebody on the street who knew me and they said "oh hey, I checked out your website—it's cool!", my goofy response would be "oh thanks! uh, which one would that be?!"…now it's that with a _vengeance_. If someone were to tell me they "liked my blog", I'd have to ask them which of the six (seven? eight? 🤣) they were referring to! Why am I doing this? **Because I decided to throw caution to the wind in 2024** and _do everything I want to do_. I marched right up to the "you shouldn't be doing that" voice in my head and told it to _go pound sand_. Now I'm running all the blogs I want to run (podcasts too very shortly!) and it's **GLORIOUS**. 🥰 (As I mentioned previously, if you're curious about the exact rundown, [I walked through the whole list in a recent episode of Fresh Fusion](/podcast/113/)).
* If you've made it this far, I just want to say **thank you!** I had so much fun throughout the past year chatting it up with incredible people across the Fediverse, and this year only seals the deal. Despite the ongoing _very strange vibes_ we're witnessing across the wider computer industry, I'm continuing to find the **open social web** _endlessly charming_ and fascinating.

And that's all folks. _See you next year!_ 😆 (Just kidding. I'll update my Now page long before then. I promise!!)
