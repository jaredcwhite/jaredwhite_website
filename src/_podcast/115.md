**Generative art**, aka artistic output that's produced by a sophisticated set of parameters, cycles, connections, and yes, even algorithms, has been around for decades‚Äîespecially in music‚Äîand has a prestigious and invigorating history. More importantly, generative art tools have helped usher in countless new art forms.

**Contrast that with‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶y'know.** üòÇ

In this so-called ‚ÄúAge of AI‚Äù we find ourselves in, it‚Äôs helpful to take a step back and remember that new generative artistic capabilities have typically given rise to vast new worlds of creative expression. Augmentation if you will, *not* substitution. Alas, _Silicon Valley seems to have lost the plot_. We should stop trusting they‚Äôre seeing something we‚Äôre not, and instead trust our own judgement in choosing tools which elevate (not badly approximate) human ingenuity and artistry.
