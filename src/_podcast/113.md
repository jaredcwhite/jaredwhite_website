title: The ‚ÄúIrrelevance‚Äù of Alternative Social Networks Was Always a Fallacy

*Sigh.* It's frustrating to _still_ feel like an early adopter of open web technology. How many years has it been? 25? 30? But here we are, trying to convince the masses that you _can_ use open protocols, networks, and software to build lasting publishing businesses and outlets for your creativity. And who better to show us the way than‚Ä¶Donald Trump? _Perish the thought!_ üò± (But seriously, it's amazing to recall everyone once scoffed at his fledgling social network once he was booted off Facebook and Twitter and‚Ä¶well, _it was hardly the kiss of death_.)

He proved Big Social just ain't so powerful anymore. Can people who aren't \*batshit crazy\* **please** take inspiration from this and use the open web for good?? TIA! üôè

Say it with me: **Own Your Own Platform**.
