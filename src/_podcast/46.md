Hello and welcome to 2020! We're kickin' into high gear on The Jared White show this year with a fresh new format where I answer listener questions each week, as well as a bonus episode exclusively for Patreon members. I go into all these changes on today's show, PLUS:

The chasm (if any) in UI/UX quality between open source and commercial social platforms, the total meltdown over at Collider Video around their change in direction on YouTube, when to upgrade an OS vs install from scratch (or buy a new Mac or PC), tons of cool links showcasing the best of the internet, top movies and streaming TV of 2019, and a whole lot more.
