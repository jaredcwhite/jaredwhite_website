title: Why I Started Creator Class (a Newsletter)
description: Creator Class is my new newsletter all about the challenges and rewards
  of being an underpaid content creator building an audience one connection at a time.
  In today's episode of Fresh Fusion, I talk about why I decided to rebrand and refocus
  my newsletter and why it's so important to highlight conversations around motivation
  and ethics in content creation. (Also why I'm ditching YouTube and going back to
  an audio-only format!)
