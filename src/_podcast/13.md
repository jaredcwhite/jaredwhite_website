title: Mastodonâ€™s Moment
description: Never fear, Professor Jared is here! You will learn all about Mastodon,
  the hot new social networking platform that is exploding in popularity and giving
  Twitter a run for its money. What makes Mastodon so exciting is it's not a single
  commercial service run by a corporationâ€”it's simply open source software using open
  protocols that anyone can install on their own server. Just like email isn't owned
  by any one company (you can email me and I can email you and we're not all forced
  to use Gmail for example), federated social networks allow online messaging and
  following/follower relationships to work much like Twitter but using the beauty
  and power of the open web.
