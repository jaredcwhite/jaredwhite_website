Some people say that *RIVEN: The Sequel to MYST* is the greatest computer game of all time. (That's me. I say that.)

Perhaps YMMV. But there's no doubt that **Riven** is the G.O.A.T. of puzzle adventure games as pioneered in the 1990s, and this year we're blessed with the **tremendous opportunity** to fall in love with Riven all over again, as Cyan has developed and published a **modern remake** in *glorious* real-time 3D. I am, quite simply, obsessed. Here's why you should be too.
