title: Meet the New Normal, Same as the Old Normal?
description: This is me stumbling my way through an episode all about systemic racism
  in zoning laws and white supremacist policies harming disenfranchised minorities,
  and how I was raised to believe affluent suburban neighborhoods are the American
  Dream. While the global pandemic has been horrifying and so very hard to stomach,
  perhaps we can also see it as a much-needed opportunity to accept just how much
  work remains to be done to bring liberty and justice to all. We shouldn't ever want
  to go "back to normal" if the new normal could be oh so much better.
