title: The Year of the Personal Cloud
description: 'In this episode, Jared gives a detailed rundown of all of the big commercial
  internet services he''s replaced with open source, self-hosted software that he
  controls himself. Why would anyone want to do this? Three words: privacy, security,
  and network health. Just as biologists know that an ecosystem with a large amount
  of organism diversity is more resilient to environmental pressures, the internet
  is more resilient to negative forces when software and content is distributed and
  spread across the network (instead of consolidated under the thumb of a few big
  corporations or governments). Save the open web by switching to your own "personal
  cloud."'

In this episode, Jared gives a detailed rundown of all of the big commercial internet services he's replaced with open source, self-hosted software that he controls himself. Why would anyone want to do this? Three words: **privacy**, **security**, and **network health**. Just as biologists know that an ecosystem with a large amount of organism diversity is more resilient to environmental pressures, the internet is more resilient to negative forces when software and content is distributed and spread across the network (instead of consolidated under the thumb of a few big corporations or governments).
