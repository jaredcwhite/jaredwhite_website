It's *the end of an era* as famed head of industrial design at Apple, Jony Ive, is leaving the company. **In this episode** I break down two Apple products I believe embody Jony's formidable design leadership and which truly set the stage for both Apple's preset and future: **iOS 7** and **iPad Pro**. I also get to touch on a couple of odd Apple-related news items as well as the new streaming service from WarnerMedia *to rival Netflix*.

Stay cool out there folks! **It's going to be a hot summer.**
