We need better stories. The "Hero's Journey" isn't going to help us. No plucky band of rebels is going to land a blow and take the fascists out in one punch. The cycle of Republic vs Evil Empire will continue forever‚Äîunless we break that cycle. Our imaginations and our ideas must expand.

Deep thoughts as I watch through the final season of _The Handmaid's Tale_ and ruminate on the ever provocative words of Jessie Gender on the nature of modern storytelling.
