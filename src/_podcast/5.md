But wait — THERE'S MORE! Next week, I'm launching a new segment called Share and Tell, and you are **invited** to send in _your_ stories of your first experience of the web. What first captivated you about the web? What motivated you to go online and explore the web? What was it like to experience this amazing new technology for the first time? Just send me an email (*jared AT jaredwhite.com*) with the subject *Share and Tell*, and I will share your story on my show next week, along with your first name, and (if you wish) a link to your website. I can't wait to hear your responses!
