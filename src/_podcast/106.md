Call it a reboot, a resurrection if you will. A new chapter in my history as a blogger. And—literally for the first time ever—a mostly-complete chronicle of all my tech blogging during a span of almost 30 years. Get ready for _The Internet Review_.

I haven’t been a general “tech blogger” in some time. This year, that all changes. I regret I never had the discipline in the 2000s to become a John Gruber, or in the 2010s to become a Jason Snell. Perhaps I don’t now. But it’s now or never. If I don’t get started on this soon, it ain’t never gonna happen.

Also, get ready for _The Internet, Reviewed_ — an exclusive podcast for [Intuitive+](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com) members! Each episode I will be looking back at a fascinating tech story from the past, a moment in the annals of internet history as presented by my past self. This is definitely a show you won’t want to miss!

And for [Fresh Fusion+](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com) members: commentary on Anil Dash's piece for _Rolling Stone_ about how the internet is about to get **weird**, and the new relationship we'll begin to see from "big box" corporate web services and the "indie web".
