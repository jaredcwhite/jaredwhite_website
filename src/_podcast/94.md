Hello my friend! Are you enjoying this podcast? [You can now support the show and share your appreciation with ☕️ Buy Me a Coffee!](https://buymeacoffee.com/jaredwhite)

Is the end game of the internet really that a bunch of algorithms slurped up a subset of popular human-created & curated content and then can regurgitate it out as if the AI is clever enough to think for itself? Meanwhile, folks in the fediverse are up in arms over the "rise" of Jack Dorsey's Bluesky (even though Bluesky's been around for years) as well as Mastodon's mobile apps nudging people to onboard via the Mastodon.social instance. Should we be concerned about imminent centralization of decentralized social networking? Is Jack Dorsey a mastermind who simultaneously helped out his buddy Elon Musk while competing directly with Twitter? LOL nope. All this and more in today's thrilling installment of Fresh Fusion.
