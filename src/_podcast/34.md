Well this is something I've never done before! My video show “Essential Life with Jared” and my podcast “The Jared White Show” have joined forces today to bring you a special video edition of the podcast!

Also, why use Vimeo instead of YouTube? Quick answer: OWN YOUR OWN PLATFORM. (Long answer: I like paying for ad-free hosting services built specifically to cater to creators. That's not what YouTube is.)

Anyway, whether you consume the audio podcast or video format of the show, I hope you enjoy it!
