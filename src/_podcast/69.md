The last two weeks have been devastating for me—on multiple fronts, both as a huge fan of the #VanLife community as well as a figure in the Ruby programming community. This podcast episode is my catharsis, as I try to work through the heartache and find something meaningful to hold on to at the end of the day. As content creators, it's only natural that a huge part of our identity is wrapped up in the work we do and the subjects we're passionate about. But what do you do when that world starts to fall apart?

**Content warning**: this episode deals with very sensitive and troubling issues. Please, if you find yourself triggered at any point, feel free to switch off the show and take care of yourself.
