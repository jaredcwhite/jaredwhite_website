title: "Heat Death of the Social Media Universe"
description: |
  In this episode of Fresh Fusion, I share some of my raw and unfiltered feelings about the meltdown of Twitter, how there’s never been a time like right now to focus squarely on “the business, the art, the ethics of content creation on the open web” (which is the tagline of this show!), my minimalism bent and desire for a Star Trek-like post-money future, reluctantly taking steps to build a “paywall” to house some of my content, and more. Buckle up folks and enjoy the ride!
