title: The Personal Website in 2021
description: Join me for a dive into my design notes! What is a "personal website"
  in 2021? How do we evolve from the mental model of the "blog" circa 2005? And how
  does that all integrate with social media, newsletters, and the like?

I've embarked on a huge restructuring and visual overhaul of [my website](https://jaredwhite.com), and as I thought about it more and more, I started asking the Big Questions such as:

* What even is a "personal website" in 2021?
* How do we evolve from the mental model of the circa-2005 "blog"?
* How can you integrate with other mediums such as social media, newsletters, and the like?
* Does the world really need me, a "white dude", endlessly pontificating on one thing or another when there needs to be space for other voices to be heard?

Join me for a dive into my design notes as I think through these sorts of questions!
