Jared is feeling a wee bit down in the mouth that his career is nearly over, apparently, due to AI coming for us all. The programmers. The musicians. The designers. The this, and the that. Or…is all of that largely utter nonsense and the artists are fighting back? (Hello WGA & SAG-AFTRA!) Let’s talk about AI and how true AGI is probably centuries away and OpenAI is trying to pull a fast one. And on today’s very exciting new [Fresh Fusion+](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com) segment: how to write and publish content on the web that is successful in search engines and social media, without giving too hoots about the snake oil that is SEO!
