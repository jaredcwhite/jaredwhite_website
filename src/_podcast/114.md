A tale of two Threads: oneâ€”the **Threadiverse**â€”is a subportion of the Fediverse dedicated to replicating the kind of experiences weâ€™re familiar with on Reddit, Hacker News, and the like; the other is Metaâ€™s fast-growing competitor to X. Not confusing at all! ðŸ˜‚

In this episode I break down what the Threadiverse is and how Iâ€™ve been using and enjoying Lemmy, and then cover the latest developments with Threads having entered the Fediverse (in a partial solution) and whatâ€™s coming nextâ€”and how itâ€™s being impacted by the Fedipact. I also cover a range of **exciting news** on the growth of the **open social web**.

And in the **Fusion+** segment this week: my spoiler-light review of Alex Garlandâ€™s heady movie _Civil War_ and the fascinating metanarrative it offers on the nature of journalism, activism, and the quest for Truth.
