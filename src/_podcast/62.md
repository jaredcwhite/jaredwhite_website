title: Big Tech is Too Powerful. Soâ€¦Now What?
description: 'In the wake of last week''s horrific events at the United States Capitol
  where domestic terrorists stormed into the building and nearly toppled a duly-elected
  Congress, one of the top questions on everyone''s mind is: what is the role of Big
  Tech in the face of extremism and anti-democratic conspiracy theories? What should
  Twitter, or Facebook, or Amazon, or Google, etc., be doing about all this? Do we
  even want them making unilateral descisions at such fundamental levels which affect
  policy making and political discourse? And just where did this violent strain of
  conservative evangelicalism come from anyway? All this and more right here on the
  Fresh Fusion podcast.'

In the wake of last week's horrific events at the United States Capitol where domestic terrorists stormed into the building and nearly toppled a duly-elected Congress, one of the top questions on _everyone's_ minds is: what is the role of Big Tech in the face of such extremism and anti-democratic conspiracy theories? What should Twitter, or Facebook, or Amazon, or Google, etc., be doing about all this? Do we even want them making unilateral descisions at such fundamental levels which affect policy making and political discourse? And just where did this violent strain of conservative evangelicalism come from anyway?

All this and more **right here** on the Fresh Fusion podcast.
