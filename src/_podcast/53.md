title: iPadOS 13.4, Photoshop for iPad, Remote Work, and Staying Home
description: What a strange and frightening time to be alive! But I'm here and I'm
  back to try to lighten the mood a bit with talk of the brand-new cursor and trackpad
  support for iPad in iPadOS 13.4, as well as speculation on how the sudden transition
  to remote work might change the business landscape for good as we look ahead. I
  also convey my impressions using Photoshop for iPad now that the new cursor-based
  input brings the user experience closer to the Mac and even surpasses it in many
  ways.
