Props if you know that very Millennial reference! We're here to talk about Gen-Z and what it's like to be a teenager in this screwy world. And by ‚Äúwe‚Äù, I mean me and my very special guest: Mike. Like all pundits worth their salt, when I want people to know more about the plight of today‚Äôs youth, I ask the only youth I know well. Yes that‚Äôs right: today I‚Äôve put on my Mr. Dad hat. _Enjoy the interview!_

(**Note:** if you think you hear knuckles cracking at one point, you are not imagining things! Sorry I wasn't able to clean up in post‚Ä¶ üòÑ)
