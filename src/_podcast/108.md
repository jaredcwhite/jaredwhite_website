It’s a new year, I’m moving my business away from HEY (to Fastmail) & Basecamp (to GitHub & Email), and I’m listening to a lot of podcasts! I talk about all of that in this episode as well as my latest blogging kick due to a small but mighty design tweak on my website.

And in the [Fusion+ segment](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com): Is podcasting still as great as it ever was? For the "big shows" with major sponsorships, probably not. BUT…for the long tail of creators out there, it’s a totally different story!
