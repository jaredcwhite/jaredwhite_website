description: |
  Where do you put the stuff that you write? Where do you post your posts? How do you publish things online now that Twitter is imploding and the Fediverse is rising? Has blogging made a comeback?

Questions abound, and I'm here to talk about all of it and my thoughts around smart growth of a healthier, more open web.
