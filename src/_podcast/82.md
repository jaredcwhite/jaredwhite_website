title: "Pocket Casts: Best Podcast Player in the World?"
description: |
  In this episode I take a deep dive into (my) history of playing podcasts over the decades, and how I eventually arrived at using Pocket Casts as my preferred podcast player of choice. Pocket Casts is chock-full of great features, not the least of which is support for playing videos (apparently not a universal feature of third-party podcast players). Listen to how I use Pocket Casts from day-to-day, as well as my thoughts on the UI design of this multi-platform (and now partially open source!) software.

In this episode I take a deep dive into (my) history of playing podcasts over the decades, and how I eventually arrived at using Pocket Casts as my preferred podcast player of choice. Pocket Casts is chock-full of great features, not the least of which is support for playing videos (apparently not a universal feature of third-party podcast players). Listen to how I use Pocket Casts from day-to-day, as well as my thoughts on the UI design of this multi-platform (and now partially open source!) software.

**CORRECTION:** in the episode I talked about [Nebula offering RSS feeds](https://blog.nebula.tv/rss-feed/) for their video channels, but unfortunately these are just standard "news" feeds to let people know about new releases. They are not _true_ video podcasts (aka you can't subscribe to them in your own podcast player). Bummer!
