Like 'em or hate 'em, the BBC is here and has joined the fediverse. In this episode I talk about what this means and more broadly why it's a good thing to see another large news organization launch their own Mastodon instance‚Äîeven while I *fully defend* other instance admins' right to defederate due to content moderation policies. And on the Fusion+ segment‚Äîavailable for free today!‚ÄîI talk all about Elon's new social network called X. Pour one out for Twitter folks. The bird is gone.
