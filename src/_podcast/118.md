It's the summer of our content, as we take time to enjoy the great outdoors and spend quality moments IRL with friends and family.

At least, that's what I've been doing, as well as making structural changes in my day-to-day such as a studio move and an email newsletter move from ConvertKit to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com). But even as the sun is shining and the birds are singing, what's happening on social media right now isâ€¦weird. And I'm not sure how to feel about it.

Like, what IS going on with the Fediverse anyway? And should we all just hold our Meta-scarred noses and embrace Threads now? Hmm. Let's talk about that.
