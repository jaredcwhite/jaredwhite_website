title: Twitter is Like a Decentralized Twitter
description: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey dropped a bombshell announcement yesterday about
  the decentralized, open-protocol-based future of Twitter, and The Jared White Show
  is here to talk about what it means for the "fediverse" (the existing federated
  social networking world of Mastodon, etc.), why Twitter is even doing this, how
  Dorsey has never been a clone of Zuckerberg, and much more. This just might be one
  of the most important episodes of the show to date!
