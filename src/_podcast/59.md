title: Retreat! Why Getting Away is the Way to Go
description: 'I just came back from a retreat. Wow! The saying is true: change of
  pace + change of place = change of perspective. As creators, we''re always working
  in one of two modes: the nose to the grindstone, going through the motions of daily
  output mode; and the 20,000 feet, blue sky thinking mode. It''s difficult, if not
  impossible, to get into that second mode in the same physical environment as where
  you''re typically heads down making incremental progress. Let''s dive into the vital
  importance of getting away in order to reinvent everything.'
