After some follow up around switching from Glass to Pixelfed and [importing new photos into my site](https://jaredwhite.com/browse/pictures) from there, I dive into the heart of the episode: how do we deal with YouTube? As fediverse-aware content creators, YouTube remains a major hurdle, but there are still ways to route around it—either partially or completely. I walk through some of the possible solutions in this episode, and then wrap up with a challenge to “long tail” content creators: what have you got to lose? The time to experiment in this space is now!

And in the [Fusion+ segment](https://plus.intuitivefuture.com): Rumor has it that Apple is working on LLM technology to integrate into Siri. Will it be any good? And will I use it?
