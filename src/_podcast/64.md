description: Tumblr is a social media platform heralding from a different time…the
  era of “Web 2.0”, when oodles of visual customization features were a given and
  open functionality like RSS feeds were compulsory. Yahoo! and Verizon nearly drove
  Tumblr to an early grave, but with the acquisition by Automattic, there is hope
  yet. Can Tumblr survive—nay—thrive in 2021? Jared White investigates.
