title: Twitter vs. Meta (A Tale of Two Social Networks)
description: |
  My kids are obsessed with "Squid Game" — even though they've (obviously!) never seen the show. "You" has taken over Netflix Top 10. Twitter vs. Meta: I'm amazed at the shockingly different trajectory these two companies are taking. The social media landscape is fracturing and it's no longer Facebook/Twitter as a monolithic duo. Let's do a deep dive into just how much Twitter has grown and changed since Jack Dorsey become CEO. Episode 75—here we go!
