title: Sick with Nazis
description: 'Jared was sick last week and so he did what comes naturally: binge watch
  Nazis. Yes, and not just Nazis but Japanese imperialists as well as the rebels who
  fight them to bring freedom to America in The Man in the High Castle—a “what if”
  scenario presented by Amazon Prime’s hit show. And if that weren’t crazy enough,
  while Jared was sick he attempted to install macOS Mojave on his iMac with less
  than stellar results (but there is a happy ending to the story). Plus Tim Cook’s
  tough talk on privacy rights, Helm fighting Google, and more. Never a dull moment
  here on The Jared White Show!'

Jared was sick last week and so he did what comes naturally: binge watch Nazis. Yes, and not just Nazis but Japanese imperialists as well as the rebels who fight them to bring freedom to America in *The Man in the High Castle*—a “what if” scenario presented by Amazon Prime’s hit show. And if that weren’t crazy enough, while Jared was sick he attempted to install macOS Mojave on his iMac with less than stellar results (but there is a happy ending to the story). Plus Tim Cook’s tough talk on privacy rights, Helm fighting Google, and more. Never a dull moment here on The Jared White Show!
