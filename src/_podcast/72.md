title: Sex Appeal, Heteronormativity, and White Supremacy in Algorithms
description: In today's episode, I step through some follow-up and a few items of
  note I've been tracking (such as the gorgeous Nikon Z fc retro-style camera!) before
  kicking off a rant about the ways algorithms privilege the already privileged instead
  of favoring content off the beaten path. Apparently you're likely to do quite well
  on YouTube if you're young, white, cis, "attractive", and so forth…but what about
  the rest of us?

In today's episode, I step through some follow-up and a few items of note I've been tracking (such as the *gorgeous* **Nikon Z fc** retro-style camera!) before kicking off a rant about the ways algorithms privilege the already privileged instead of favoring content off the beaten path. Apparently you're likely to do quite well on YouTube if you're young, white, cis, "attractive", and so forth…but what about the rest of us?
