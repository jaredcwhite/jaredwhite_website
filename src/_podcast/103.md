description: I’m a die-hard Ivory for Mastodon user and “ambassador” of the Fediverse. So then, why am I on Threads? Well, it’s all about who you follow, and you can follow many interesting sorts of accounts there which aren’t all on Mastodon. In this episode, I break down the various categories of accounts I follow, as well as talk about some of the other social media news of the day.

I’m a die-hard [Ivory for Mastodon](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) user and “ambassador” of the Fediverse. So then, why am I on Threads? Well, it’s all about who you follow, and you can follow many interesting sorts of accounts there which aren’t all on Mastodon. Once Threads enables ActivityPub, I intend to follow all these accounts from Mastodon, but in the meantime, I must be on Threads. In this episode, I break down the various categories of accounts I follow, as well as talk about some of the other social media news of the day. There’s also a poetry reading and some soundboard shenanigans. As Eddy Cue might say, _I can’t wait to do it!_
