title: 'Portland: Paradise or Perdition?'
description: This is a deeply personal episode. I spent most of my life within a 60
  miles radius of where I was born. That all changed when I relocated to the Portland,
  Oregon metro area. I came here on a fact-finding mission in 2017 and fell head-over-heels
  in love with the place. It's no accident in the slightest that the most creative
  period in my entire life has transpired right here in Portland. I guess that's why
  it's a real sore spot for me when I see Portland dragged through the mud in the
  press—not to mention the whole concept of living in a dense urban environment. Are
  moving to the suburbs really the answer to the challenges of pandemic living? Does
  living in a "hip" city really have any influence on high-level creativity and artistic
  scope? Tune in to hear my story and my take.

**Subtitle: Rumors of Portland's Death Are Greatly Exaggerated**

This is a deeply personal episode. I spent most of my life within a 60 miles radius of where I was born. That all changed when I relocated to the Portland, Oregon metro area. I came here on a fact-finding mission in 2017 and fell head-over-heels in love with the place. It's no accident in the slightest that the most creative period in my entire life has transpired right here in Portland. I guess that's why it's a real sore spot for me when I see Portland dragged through the mud in the press—not to mention the whole concept of living in a dense urban environment. Are moving to the suburbs really the answer to the challenges of pandemic living? Does living in a "hip" city really have any influence on high-level creativity and artistic scope? Tune in to hear my story and my take.
