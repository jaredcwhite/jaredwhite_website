As Arnold would say, _I’m back, baby!_ Yes, I am **rebooting** my first blog ever, and this new daily weblog all about tech and nerd culture news with a dash of fun 90s nostalgia on the side will feature archives reaching all the way back to 1996. Are you excited yet? You should be! This site best viewed with Netscape Navigator! (Just kidding.) …But that **would** be _hilarious!_
