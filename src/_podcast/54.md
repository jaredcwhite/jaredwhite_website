Greetings, fellow citizens of the internet refuge from the global pandemic! How are you surviving Crisis? I am, to echo the words of Morpheus, STILL HERE! ðŸ’ª

In this episode I bring you up to speed on what I've been up toâ€¦some fun things, some rewarding things, and one terrible, horrible, no good, very bad thing I've been battling with for a couple of months now (predating the coronavirus lockdown!). If you've been wondering how I've been fairing as a Dad during this whole shelter-at-home situationâ€¦well, the answer may surprise you. And at the very least, tune in for my barely-tolerable impression of Agent Smith from The Matrix! ðŸ˜Ž
