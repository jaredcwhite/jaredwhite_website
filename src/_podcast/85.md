  Happy New Year everybody! I meant to record this show last week, but I was sick for most of the holidays. Oh well. I'm just glad I *have* a top ten list like this because honestly, I thought a lot of geek entertainment fare earlier this year rather sucked (quite a few disappointments coming from Disney in particular). Thankfully, things picked up as the year progressed, and we were able to finish out 2022 with an excellent list of some of my favorite properties not just in 2022 but ever. Let's dive in!
