title: Yes, Users DO Care About the Tools You Use
description: It's the first official new episode of Fresh Fusion, and it's a doozy!
  There's an oft-expressed notion rooted in misguided pragmatism that says your users/customers/audience
  don't care about the tools you use behind the scenes. They only care about the final
  product. I fundamentally reject such a notion, and I'm here to tell you why. Users
  DO care about the tools you use, because you MAKE them care. That's your job as
  a creator. That's your job as a marketer. Let's dive in!
