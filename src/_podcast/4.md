title: Always in Haste, Never in a Hurry
description: A man of rituals (but not the kind that involve funny hats and long robes),
  Jared in this episode talks about identifying and honoring daily routines that make
  us happy, how to create digital experiences that are ethical and respect users,
  minimalism, freedom from slavery, and the opposite of that—aka Jeff Sessions' un-Christian
  separation of children from their familes. Just another day on The Jared White Show!
