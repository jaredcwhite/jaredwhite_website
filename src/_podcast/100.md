We made it folks. ONE HUNDRED EPISODES! ðŸŽ‰ On this 100th installment of Fresh Fusion, it is my extreme pleasure to welcome writer, founder, and marketing expert Mariya Delano to the show for a lively conversation about the growth of the internet and social media, when things started to go terribly awry, the cultural shift that's happening RIGHT NOW, and where she believes this is all headed. (Spoiler alert: there really is lots to be hopeful about!)

Note: we recorded this before Twitter's sudden rebrand to "X". Thatâ€¦will have to wait for another day! ðŸ˜‚
