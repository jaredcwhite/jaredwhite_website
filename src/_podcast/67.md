title: O Patreon, You Done Me Wrong
description: I opened the Patreon mobile app on my iPhone. I looked at the feed. Suddenly,
  in the twinkling of an eye, POOF! A bunch of the creators I follow vanished. Gone.
  Out of this world. Did they suddenly shut down all their accounts? Was there a rapture
  and I wasn’t notified? No, it was none of those things. Patreon just had a temporary
  snafu billing my debit card, and because of that, I was unceremoniously placed in
  fan purgatory with little elucidation of my crimes. This wasn’t a temporary user
  experience glitch. This was a UX disaster. And yet, buried in their help center,
  Patreon states this is exactly how they handle such matters. Boo! Creators and fans
  deserve better.
