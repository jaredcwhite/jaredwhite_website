Itâ€™s that time of year again in the U.S. of A.â€”time to take stock of where weâ€™ve been and find all of the silver linings. And itâ€™s time for this podcaster to geek out over some very special blessings, from weird quirky indie horror films to weird quirky indie web browsers as well as weird quirky indieâ€¦OK, I think you get the idea. ðŸ˜„ Also some thoughts on why thereâ€™s value in staying engaged in local politics even when national elections are a source of undying gloom. And guess what? *Yearly intentions work!* But enough about me. What are _you_ thankful for this holiday season?
