title: Facebook 2020
description: Hindsight is 2020, but that won’t stop us from talking about what kind
  of company and what kind of social network Facebook will be as we head into 2020
  and the height of the U.S. political season. Will regulation force Facebook, Twitter,
  and other massive networks to interoperate with newer, smaller networks? Will the
  values of free expression online prevail? Will the specter of Chinese censorship
  change the debate on what we expect from social networks here in America? All in
  a day’s conversation here at The Jared White Show.
